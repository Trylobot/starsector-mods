_Mercenary Fleet Formations_
  * ability to hire (potentially many) mercenary fleets to escort you
  * mercenary fleets require bi-weekly wages and must be allowed to resupply
  * escorts automatically occupy formation slots, of a formation chosen by the player
  * chosen formation can be altered at any time via a custom fleet formation menu
  * can access mercenary fleets to refit/mothball/set flagship etc.
  * can access mercenary fleets' inventories, and freely move things about

_Dubstep ship_ (crossover ship inspired by Saint's Row IV and DubWars for OUYA)
  * ship will resemble a combination turntable/boombox with tons of animated bits and bobs
  * gun firing sound loop: cropped version of "Scout McMillan - Polyhymnia" or alternative public domain music
  * effects:
    * laser fireworks
    * sparkles
    * beams

_Hyper-Magnetic Grappling Claw_
  * weapon with special behavior
  * activates a decorative weapon animation depicting a long claw arm which extends out from the ship
  * upon contact with any ship or hulk, the claw arm engages
  * the target is now firmly attached to the attacking ship
  * both ships at that point lose access to weapons and shields
  * unless the attacking ship de-activates the claw, or is destroyed.

_GTA-Style "Wanted" Level + Suicidal Fleets_
  * if you piss off a faction real bad, they start to respond to your actions as a faction
  * they'll send fleets to attack you, and there will be more of their fleets active in the system
  * fleets will attack you even if they have no chance of winning, simply to wear you down for other fleets
  * wanted level can be reduced by not getting into fights with them for a while
  * custom "star level" UI in top right, somehow
 
_Dodge-the-Asteroids minigame_ (total conversion)
  * removes all ships from the game, and gives you a standalone command pod ship only
  * if you touch an asteroid in the campaign map, you go into a combat instance
  * no enemy ships in the combat instance, retreat to top of map
  * lots of asteroids in map flying everywhere
  * varying difficulty (upward)
