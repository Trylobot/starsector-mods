sc2_ur-quan_dreadnought,SHIP,"The Ur-Quan Kzer-Za Dreadnought is the mainstay of the Hierarchy fleet. A fully-crewed Dreadnought can crush most other spacecraft with ease. The Dreadnought also doubles as a planetary siege unit; the ship is capable of punching through stationary fortifications, destroying large structures on and beneath a planet's surface, and subduing alien worlds without support. ",,,
sc2_ur-quan_autonomous_fighter,SHIP,"Small, one-man fighters armed with lasers to harass the enemy. A swarm of these can team up to puncture an enemy ship's hull in seconds. Each fighter has only a limited supply of life support and fuel and must return to the Dreadnought after its brief sortie.",,,
sc2_earthling_cruiser,SHIP,"The Earthling Cruiser is a vessel of happenstance. Humanity was brought into the Ur-Quan Slave War with almost no preparation. It was only their long history of proliferation that allowed this vessel to be so effective in the battle against the Ur-Quan Hierarchy. A massive industrial base located at Detroit, Michigan, USA churned out vast numbers of Cruisers which for a time acted as the backbone of the Allied fleet.",,,
sc2_orz_nemesis,SHIP,"Underestimating the Orz Nemesis would likely be the last mistake any captain makes. As its name suggests, this ship is a goddess of revenge, coming to inflict pain and vengeance on the galaxy. Never, under any circumstances, chase after the Nemesis!",,,
sc2_melnorme_trader,SHIP,"The Melnorme Trader is a large and somewhat cumbersome ship. It is designed for long range travel and high volume storage to facilitate trade. The Trader is not intended for war. Despite that, it is still quite capable of defending itself due to recently acquired Keel-Verezy weapon technology.",,,
sc2_yehat_terminator,SHIP,The Yehat Terminator is a small yet powerful vessel that possesses moderate movement characteristics. It is capable of inflicting heavy damage at close range and rendering itself temporarily immune to most enemy attacks.,,,
sc2_mmrnmhrm_x-form_x-wing,SHIP,"Flexibility is the key to survival. The robotic Mmrnmhrm understood this concept, as proven by their agreement to join the Chenjesu in their ""Process"", and their warships have integrated this concept wholly and fully. The Mmrnmhrm X-Form, also known as the Mmrnmhrm Transformer, could quickly transform from the slow but powerful X-Wing form to the quick, stinging Y-Wing form.",,,
sc2_mmrnmhrm_x-form_y-wing,SHIP,"Flexibility is the key to survival. The robotic Mmrnmhrm understood this concept, as proven by their agreement to join the Chenjesu in their ""Process"", and their warships have integrated this concept wholly and fully. The Mmrnmhrm X-Form, also known as the Mmrnmhrm Transformer, could quickly transform from the slow but powerful X-Wing form to the quick, stinging Y-Wing form.",,,
sc2_spathi_discriminator,SHIP,"The multi-colored Spathi Discriminator, remains the bulk of the Spathi fleet even 20 years after the war. Its construction, though seemingly chaotic, is carefully designed to mimic its crew's natural attributes: paranoia, elusiveness, and cowardice. From the outside, the Eluder consists of many bubble-shaped, solid-colored cabins joined together by smaller gray corridors. The intention of having so many large seemingly crew-filled projections is partly to obfuscate enemy into targeting the decoy cabins and to direct enemy fire away from the sections where the crew resides.",,,
sc2_vux_intruder,SHIP,"The VUX Intruder is both slow and unmaneuverable, but it compensates for this by utilizing limpet parasites to slow down enemy vessels. Intruders are armed with a powerful gigawatt laser that can slice through any ship in a matter of seconds. Its modest range and rapid energy consumption demand a certain amount of skill in order for it to be used effectively, however.",,,
