  
  Ur-Quan Dreadnought
    Autonomous Fighters
      Fighters currently can't be launched from ships at will, they are omni-present
      Fighter launching should be initiated as a weapon, which should cost flux
      The fighters need to have a limited amount of fuel and auto-return
      The fighters should collide with asteroids and when they do, die
      Fighters for now will start and exist as separate ships, but will be very weak by Starfarer standards
    
  Earthling Cruiser
    Point-Defense Laser
      The laser is supposed to be able to engage multiple targets at the same time, so I'll create 12 laser weapons each occupying a pie-shaped region, originating at the same spot. No two should be able to target the same thing, and they'll all use less flux than normal. Hopefully that will work to evoke what we want.
      The laser is supposed to destroy asteroids, but nothing targets asteroids yet
  
  Orz Nemesis
    Space Marines
      This is similar to the Dreadnought's fighter problem; they need to be launched from the ship for some cost, but this isn't possible currently, so they'll have to start at the same time as the ship and be auto-balanced somehow
