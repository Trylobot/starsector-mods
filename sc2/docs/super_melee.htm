<b>0. INTRODUCTION
===============</b>
o This document provides information on Star Control II: Super Melee that does
  not explicitly appear in the manual included with the game.  Many of the
  facts and tips found here will already be known to anyone who has played
  before; However, this document explores a wide variety of topics in detail,
  and should reveal useful information to novice and experienced players alike.

o A Panasonic REAL 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, model FZ-1, equipped with two
  standard Panasonic 3DO controllers (model FZ-JP1X) was used as the basis for
  the controller descriptions and real-time measurements in this document.

o This document is 79 characters wide, and is best viewed in a monospaced font.

<a name="1"></a>
<b>1. GAME CONTROL
===============</b>
o In references to combat situations, the terms "B button" and "C button" in
  this document apply to those buttons on the face of the controller, and also
  to the right and left "Shift" buttons (respectively) on the top edge of the
  controller.  The term "D button" refers to the controller's directional pad.
  In references to combat situations, the term "A button" would also apply to
  the up arrow on the D button/directional pad.

o After Super Melee is chosen from the Options screen (the "New Game/Super
  Melee!/Load Game" screen), the teams shown (if any) will be the last teams
  that were created or loaded before Stopping and quitting to the Options
  screen.  (Changes made on the team construction screen are not saved if the
  system is powered down without returning to the Options screen first.)

o The game will recognize up to 2 controllers.  Additional controllers are
  ignored.

o If 2 controllers are attached, either one can be used to select game options
  before combat.

o While building teams, the B button will toggle the cursor between the
  "BATTLE!" option and the upper-left position on the top team.

o When selecting a ship for placement on a team, the cursor can "wrap around"
  at the edges of the "PICK SHIP/SHIP INFO" grid.

o Any controller button can be used to exit the audio/visual ship descriptions
  selected from the "PICK SHIP/SHIP INFO" grid.

o The B button will exit the "PICK SHIP/SHIP INFO" grid.

o While loading teams, or editing teams and team names, some buttons (primarily
  the B button and directional pad arrows) can automatically repeat when they
  are held down.  While a button is held down and is automatically repeating a
  function, its repeat rate will increase until its maximum repeat speed is
  attained.  After that button is released, its initial repeat rate is reset to
  minimum.

o There may be from 1 to 12 ships per team.  An "empty" team (0 ships) cannot
  be saved or played.

o When editing team names, the down arrow will advance forward through the
  character set 1 character at a time, and the up arrow will reverse through
  the character set 1 character at a time.

o Character set for team names, in forward (down-arrow) order: "a"/"A" through
  "z"/"Z", "0" through "9", " " (space).  When advancing past " " or reversing
  past "a"/"A", the character set "wraps" to the opposite end.

o When editing team names, both the left and right Shift buttons will toggle
  capitalization on and off.  (Capitalization remains on or off until a Shift
  button is hit again.)

o Team names can be from 0 to 15 characters in length.

o When the Save command is used, the team saved will always be stored below the
  built-in teams (the last built-in team being "The Peeled Eyes").  User-saved
  teams will be sorted by team name.  Alphabetical priority is " " (space), ""
  (blank, no name), "0" through "9", "a" through "z", "A" through "Z".  If two
  user-saved teams have the same name, the first team is replaced by the
  second.  Built-in teams cannot be replaced.

o The 3DO Storage Manager program (available on the 3DO "Sampler CD", item
  DFJN5001ZBZ) will indicate that user-saved teams of any size will each
  consume 1 percent of the 3DO's storage space.  In reality, teams consume far
  less space.  ("1%" is the smallest value Storage Manager can show for saved
  items.)

o For two-player combat, the ships on the top team respond to the secondary
  controller; The ships on the bottom team respond to the primary controller.

o For ship selection during a two-player game, either controller can be used to
  select ships from either team.  However, when it's a player's turn to select
  a ship, the A, B, C and D buttons on the opponent's controller will be locked
  out for 3 seconds, and this 3-second lockout timer restarts each time the A,
  B, C or D button on the player's controller is pressed.  Note that Stopping
  and Pausing a game will not halt the lockout countdown, and the B button on
  either controller can always be used to quit a Stopped game.

o In Human-Cyborg combat, any controller can be used to select and control the
  Human player's ships.

o When selecting a ship for combat, the cursor can "wrap around" at the edges
  of the team display.

o When selecting a ship for combat, choosing the red, round "X" symbol under
  the question mark will freeze the game and prompt the player(s) to press B.
  At this point, the B button will exit the game and return to the team
  construction screen, while pressing any other button will clear the prompt
  and continue the game.

o If both teams are under Cyborg control, rounds of combat will continue
  automatically and indefinitely unless/until interrupted.  When either side
  has won a game, the team construction screen reappears.  Another game will
  begin after a 10 second countdown.  (Note that this countdown timer begins
  the moment the Cyborg option has been selected for both teams, but is reset
  each time an A, B, C or D button is pressed.  Also, if the cursor is moved
  left, off the list of options, the countdown is cancelled.)

o The game cannot be Paused or Stopped while a Cyborg opponent is selecting a
  ship for combat.

o The B button will quit a Stopped game; any other button (on either
  controller) will continue a Stopped game.

o Only the Pause button will continue a Paused game.

o Pressing and holding Pause repeatedly will advance a game in progress at the
  rate of about 1 "frame" per button press.

o Stopping or Pausing a game will not interrupt music or a sound effect.

o When a game is Stopped and the B button is pressed, Super Melee quits to the
  Options screen (the "New Game/Super Melee!/Load Game" screen).

<b>2. THE COMBAT SCREEN
====================</b>
o During ship-to-ship combat, the screen will continuously center itself on the
  midpoint of an imaginary line drawn between the two ships.  When one ship is
  in motion, this centering effect can give a false impression that both ships
  are moving.

o The screen will zoom in on the pair of ships as they come closer together,
  and zoom out again as they move apart.  A full-sized screen (zoomed all the
  way out) shows 25% of the total combat area.

o Combat occurs in a rectangle of space four times the size of a full-sized
  screen.  The opposite edges of this rectangle are linked, meaning that an
  object exiting one side of the rectangle is simultaneously re-entering at the
  opposite side.  Because of this "wrap around" effect, the maximum distance
  (in at least one direction) between any two objects will never exceed the
  diagonal measurement of one full-sized screen.

o Note that overall game play may slow down or speed up at times.  Often this
  is due to an increase or decrease in the number of objects being displayed on
  the screen.  Because of this speed fluctuation, ship recharging rates and
  other events can vary in real time by a few seconds.

o If a ship is boarded by an enemy Orz marine, a marine icon appears on the top
  half of that ship's status display.  Up to 8 marine icons can appear on a
  status display, echoing the maximum number of enemy marines which can be
  aboard a ship at one time.  If a marine fires on the ship's crew, the icon
  representing that marine will flash.  If the marine is destroyed, its icon
  will disappear from the status display.

o If a ship acquires an enemy VUX limpet parasite, a parasite appears on the
  ship image in that ship's status display.

<a name="3"></a>
<b>3. STARS
========</b>
o The stars appearing in the combat zone are actually 3 overlapping star
  fields.  If either ship is in motion, the three fields may appear to move
  independently.  (Stars within each field remain fixed relative to each
  other.)  The foreground stars (which appear larger as the screen zooms in)
  are the best guide for determining a ship's true state of motion, as the
  background/smaller stars can appear to move even if the ship in question is
  stationary.

o Stars will have no direct effect on anything in the combat area.

<a name="4"></a>
<b>4. ASTEROIDS
============</b>
o There are 5 asteroids at any given time.  When one is destroyed, a new one is
  generated off-screen, set rotating at a random speed either way about the one
  axis chosen for all asteroids, and set in linear motion at a random speed in
  a random direction.

o If a ship arrives in the combat area and materializes on top of an asteroid,
  the asteroid passes under the ship, and neither object is affected.

o Ships will not be damaged by collisions with asteroids, however the course
  and speed of both objects are likely to be affected.

o Asteroids can be destroyed by all weapon systems except the Chmmr tractor
  field, the Melnorme EM "confusion" pulse, the Syreen Song, and VUX limpet
  parasites.  They are also destroyed if they touch the planet.  (Occasional,
  unexpected *Smack!* sounds are often asteroids striking the planet, which may
  be off-screen at the time.)

o As an asteroid is destroyed, it loses all momentum and tangibility.  Any
  asteroid fragments produced will have no effect on anything, and quickly
  disappear.

o With the exception of the Chmmr tractor field, the Melnorme EM "confusion"
  pulse, the Shofixti Divine Wind, the Slylandro energizer field, the Syreen
  Song, and the Umgah antimatter cone, an asteroid will always destroy any
  projectile encountered.

o An asteroid's linear and rotational motion can be suspended when it is in
  contact with a ship, but its motion will resume when contact is broken.  (As
  long as an asteroid exists, it will never stop moving unless it's being held
  in place by a ship or some other object.)

<a name="5"></a>
<b>5. PLANET
=========</b>
o The planet type/color is selected randomly before the first combat encounter,
  and remains unchanged from round to round.

o As a ship enters combat, its hyperspace trail may pass near (or through) the
  planet.  This will have no effect on the ship.

o All planets are the same size and exert the same gravitational force.

o Gravity extends in all directions from the center of the planet to a distance
  of just under 4 times its diameter.  Beyond that perimeter gravity drops to
  zero.  Note that planets are the only objects in the game that exert a
  gravitational force.

o Most slow-moving solid objects can achieve orbit around the planet.  This
  includes asteroids, most ships, and even free-floating hypnotized crew
  members.

o When a ship or other solid object touches the planet, the ship or object will
  take a minimum of 1 point of damage (see the definition of damage in <a href="#39">section</a>
  <a href="#39">39: Projectiles</a>).  Prolonged or repeated contact with the planet will destroy
  any ship or solid object.

o The shields of the Utwig Jugger and Yehat Terminator cannot protect those
  ships from damage caused by collision with the planet.

o The planet will block all beam projectiles, and most missile projectiles.  It
  will not block the effects of the Chmmr tractor field, the Melnorme EM
  "confusion" pulse, the Shofixti Glory Device, the Slylandro energizer, the
  Syreen Song, or the Umgah antimatter cone.

o The planet cannot be damaged or destroyed, and cannot be moved (its position
  is fixed within the foreground-star field).

<a name="6"></a>
<b>6. BASIC SHIP MANEUVERING
=========================</b>
o Ships cannot be controlled or affected as they are entering the combat zone.

o When most ships first enter the combat zone, they materialize in a location
  chosen at random from a limited number of possibilities.  The one exception
  is the VUX Intruder, which, when entering an occupied combat zone, attempts
  to materialize close to the enemy ship's location.  (Note, however, that this
  materialization point is chosen just before the VUX enters the combat zone,
  and while the VUX is decelerating from hyperspace, the enemy ship may have a
  brief moment to move away.)

o When a ship arrives in the combat area, there is a slim chance that it will
  appear inside the planet's gravity field.

o There is a remote chance that a ship will arrive in the combat area and
  materialize in the same location as the enemy ship.  When this happens, one
  ship will overlap the other on the screen.  This effect will not cause damage
  to either ship.

o Ships can rotate through 16 orientations (360 degrees at 22.5-degree
  intervals).  Non-homing missiles cannot be launched into the "blind spots"
  between these 16 firing angles, and non-homing beams cannot be swept through
  them.

o Ships will not gain momentum by turning.  Rotation for all non-Slylandro
  ships will always cease when the D button is released (unless the ship is
  under the influence of the Melnorme EM "confusion" pulse).

o Gravity (or lack thereof) has no effect on a ship's turn rate.

o In most cases, a drifting ship can be brought to a complete stop only if its
  final motion is along a perfect north-south or east-west line.  Example: A
  ship at full stop which begins moving north using a minimal burst of forward
  thrust will return to a full stop if the ship is then rotated 180 degrees to
  face south, and an equal amount of thrust is applied.  However, if this
  maneuver was repeated using a northeast/southwest line, the ship would retain
  a fraction of its momentum at the end of the maneuver.  (Note that this
  example excludes any influence by gravity, collisions, weapon effects, etc.,
  and does not apply to the Ariloulaleelay Skiff, the Androsynth Guardian in
  Blazer form, or the Slylandro Probe, as these ships cannot drift under normal
  circumstances.)

o With the exception of the Ariloulaleelay Skiff, the Androsynth Guardian in
  Blazer form, and the Slylandro Probe, any ship can use the planetary
  "slingshot effect".  Specifically, passing close to the planet while applying
  continuous thrust will boost a ship's speed, often by a great deal.

o With the exception of the Ariloulaleelay Skiff, the Androsynth Guardian in
  Blazer form, and the Slylandro Probe, any ship can achieve orbit around the
  planet.  To do this, thrust on a straight course that will intersect the
  planet's gravity field, but not the planetary body itself.  Before the ship
  reaches the gravity field, turn off thrust and rotate the ship 180 degrees.
  As the ship enters the gravity field, apply thrust as necessary to slow the
  ship to just below escape velocity.  A different amount/duration of thrust
  will be required here depending on the type of ship and its speed.

o If a ship under very low thrust (or one impaired by limpet parasites) is
  trapped in the planet's gravity field, it will be pulled to the surface and
  eventually destroyed unless it can escape or achieve orbit.  In this case,
  simply thrusting directly against the pull of gravity will probably not work.
  Try keeping the ship pointed 90 to 135 degrees away from the planet's core
  while applying continuous thrust.  (This flight path, projected, would
  describe a widening spiral around and away from the core of the planet.)

o Occasionally a ship will gain an excess of momentum from contact with slower
  (or stationary) objects, and will bounce away from the object at high
  velocity.  Collision with the planet tends to cause this effect most often,
  although on rare occasions contact with asteroids or Chenjesu DOGIs will
  produce similar results.

o With the exception of the Chmmr tractor field and the Druuge cannon shell,
  the influence or impact of any projectile will not affect a surviving ship's
  inertia or direction of motion.  With the exception of the Melnorme EM
  "confusion" pulse, the influence or impact of any projectile will not affect
  a surviving ship's rotational orientation in space.

<b>7. SHIP ATTRIBUTES: GENERAL
===========================</b>
o Unless otherwise specified, ship attributes described in this document (crew
  and energy point levels, thrust speeds, turn rates, firing rates, etc.)
  assume no influence by collisions, gravity or weapon effects.

o Unless otherwise specified, energy consumption figures in this document
  indicate the maximum energy consumed for minimal use of a system.

o Unless otherwise specified, all weapon projectiles are fired directly forward
  from the center of the front end of the ship.

o Unless otherwise specified, weapon/ability usage rates expressed in this
  document indicate the number of consecutive uses of a weapon or ability at
  its maximum repeat speed, assuming a standard maximum starting energy level
  and no simultaneous recharging or discharging through attacks or usage of
  other ship systems.

o Note that overall game play may slow down or speed up at times.  Often this
  is due to an increase or decrease in the number of objects being displayed on
  the screen.  Because of this speed fluctuation, ship recharging rates and
  other events can vary in real time by a few seconds.

o Up until it is destroyed, a ship's performance will not be affected by loss
  of crew members, except where crew members are used in marine and fighter
  launchings.

o There are 16 possible captain names for each ship type.  When two ships of
  the same ship type are in combat, both ships may have the same captain name.

o Combat value points in this game are roughly equivalent to the "Starbuck"
  values used in earlier Star Control games.

<a name="8"></a>
<b>8. ANDROSYNTH GUARDIAN
======================</b>
o This ship is also known as the Androsynth Blazer.

o Combat value is 15.  Starts with 20 crew, 24 energy points.

o Acid bubble weapon detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 3 energy
  points to fire.  Can launch 8 bubbles at a time if energy is at maximum.  A
  hit does 2 points of damage.

o The Androsynth acid bubble is a homing "missile" projectile.

o The Androsynth will not be damaged by its own bubbles.

o "Blazer" form/mode detail: Activated with the C button.  Costs 1 energy point
  about every .36 seconds, until all energy is used (it will engage on as
  little as 2 energy points).  Blazer form will last about 8.6 seconds if
  energy is at maximum.  The Blazer field created and maintained during this
  transformation does 3 points of damage.

o When Blazer mode is engaged, the ship's hull transforms to a comet-like
  shape.  (Note that the new hull is comprised of the entire comet shape, not
  just the central sphere.)  The new hull is also completely enveloped in a
  field which can damage/destroy asteroids, enemy ships, DOGIs, Zapsats,
  marines, hypnotized crew or fighters on contact.

o The Blazer field is considered to have a range of zero, as it will only
  affect objects in direct contact with the Androsynth's hull.

o While Blazer mode is engaged, forward thrust is maintained at maximum.  (Note
  that the maximum speed of the Blazer form is well above the maximum speed of
  the initial form.)

o The Androsynth loses all momentum during Blazer mode, and will come to a full
  stop when it's disengaged.

o The Blazer form's speed and maneuverability are not affected by VUX limpet
  parasites.  (Note that parasites picked up by an Androsynth in Blazer form
  will remain to affect its initial form.)

o Blazer form's course is not affected by gravity.

o An Androsynth cannot engage Blazer mode if an object is occupying the space
  that the new shape must occupy.  For example, if an asteroid is in direct
  contact with the aft of an Androsynth's hull, the Blazer form's "comet tail"
  has no room to form, and therefore Blazer mode will not activate.

o On occasion, an Androsynth's attributes may become mutated after contact with
  a Chenjesu DOGI.  Specifically, the Androsynth must be in Blazer mode, and
  must have 10 or fewer energy points when the DOGI is touched.  At that
  moment, the Androsynth is forced out of Blazer mode (the last of its energy
  is drained by the DOGI), and the DOGI is destroyed.  From this point on, the
  Androsynth's initial form will retain the Blazer form's increased turning
  rate and ability to damage or destroy objects that touch the hull.  This
  mutation is permanent, and will last through subsequent transformations
  between initial and full Blazer form.

o The Androsynth can still take damage from projectiles while in Blazer form.

o In general, marines cannot enter the Androsynth Guardian while it is in
  Blazer form (the marine is usually destroyed, and the Androsynth may be
  deflected slightly).  However, if several marines touch the hull
  simultaneously, a boarding can occur.

o The Androsynth does not generate energy while in Blazer form.

o The Androsynth cannot release acid bubbles while in Blazer form.

o When an Androsynth in Blazer form attempts to ram an enemy ship, there is a
  slim chance that the Androsynth will pass over the enemy ship.  Neither ship
  will be damaged while this is happening.

o Androsynth captain names: AK-47, BHS-79, BIM-XT, BOOJI-1, CRC-16, DORN-3,
  DOS-1.0, HAL-2001, JOR-15, KORB-7B, ME-262, NECRO-99, SR-71, XR4-TI,
  976-KILL, 1040-EZ.

o The version of the Androsynth Guardian that appears in this game varies
  slightly from a version that appeared some earlier Star Control games.  (The
  damage caused by the Blazer field has been increased from 2 to 3 points, and
  the minimum energy required to activate Blazer mode has been increased from 1
  to 2 points.)

<b>9. ARILOULALEELAY SKIFF
=======================</b>
o Combat value is 16.  Starts with 6 crew, 20 energy points.

o The Ariloulaleelay utilizes a momentumless drive system.

o Laser weapon detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 2 energy points to
  fire.  Can fire 10 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if energy is at
  maximum.  A hit does 1 point of damage.

o The Arilou laser beam is considered a homing projectile, here.

o The laser will only attempt to fire in the direction of the enemy ship, and
  will not seek or lock onto asteroids, the planet, DOGIs, Zapsats, marines,
  hypnotized crew, fighters or projectiles.  If the enemy ship is cloaked or
  destroyed, the Arilou's laser will fire forward from between the headlights.

o Hyperjump detail: Activated with the C button.  Costs 3 energy points to use.
  Can jump 6 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if energy is at maximum.

o Although the hyperjump will change the location of the ship, it will not
  change the ship's rotational orientation.

o When the Arilou hyperjumps, it can appear anywhere within the combat area,
  including a location shared with any object.  An Arilou is instantly
  destroyed if it appears on an asteroid, the planet, or an enemy ship (the
  asteroid, planet or enemy ship remains unaffected).

o The hyperjump ability is not affected by VUX limpet parasites.

o Gravity will usually have no effect on an Ariloulaleelay Skiff, and under
  normal circumstances an Arilou cannot gain or lose speed by moving through a
  planet's gravity field, cannot achieve orbit, and cannot be pulled to a
  planet's surface.  However, if an Arilou acquires several limpet parasites,
  it will begin to succumb to gravity when it applies thrust near the planet.

o Under normal circumstances, the Chmmr Avatar's tractor field cannot move an
  Ariloulaleelay Skiff.  However, if an Arilou has acquired VUX limpet
  parasites, it can be affected.  The more parasites on the Arilou, the greater
  the effect of the tractor field.  Note, however, that the Arilou can only be
  affected while it is thrusting.

o Ariloulaleelay captain names: Bezabu, Dingdup, Fefaloo, Loleelu, Louifoui,
  Marypup, Oowbabe, Patooti, Pinywiny, Ropilup, Tifiwilo, Tinkafo, Tiptushi,
  Wewalia, Wolwali, Yipyapi.

<b>10. CHENJESU BROODHOME
======================</b>
o Combat value is 28.  Starts with 36 crew, 30 energy points.

o Crystal Shard weapon detail: Activated with the B button, held down for a
  variable time before release.  Costs 5 energy points to fire.  Can launch/
  detonate 6 Shards in a row at the highest repeat rate if energy is at
  maximum.  A direct hit with the entire crystal does 6 points of damage.  If
  the crystal is detonated before impact, it will break into 8 fragments (360
  degrees at 45-degree intervals), which do 2 points of damage apiece.

o The Chenjesu crystal Shard is a non-homing "missile" projectile.

o While launching, a Shard will travel indefinitely until the B button is
  released, the Shard is destroyed in a collision, or the launching Chenjesu is
  destroyed (causing the Shard to detonate).  If the Shard goes off the edge of
  the screen, it can eventually "wrap around", approaching from the opposite
  edge.  If the Shard reaches the launching Chenjesu, it will pass overhead,
  doing no damage.

o While the crystal Shard (as a whole or in fragments) will not damage the
  launching Chenjesu, it can damage or destroy the Chenjesu's DOGIs.

o The Shard's course can be affected by gravity.

o DOGI launch detail: Activated with the C button.  Costs (all) 30 energy
  points to launch.  Only 1 DOGI at a time can be launched without recharging.

o When a DOGI is released, it appears immediately aft of the Broodhome.

o If a DOGI is released directly onto an asteroid, planet, enemy ship or
  marine, the DOGI is instantly destroyed.  The asteroid, planet, enemy ship or
  marine will not be affected.

o Each Broodhome can have up to 4 DOGIs deployed at one time.  They can be
  replaced indefinitely as they are destroyed.

o Chenjesu captain names: Brrzap, Bzrak, Fzzzz, Hmmhmm, Krrtzz, Kzzakk,
  Pzkrakz, Tzaprak, Tzrrow, Vrroww, Vziziz, Zxzakz, Zzmzmm, Zznaz, Zzzhmm,

<b>11. CHENJESU DOGI
=================</b>
o When a DOGI is released, it appears immediately aft of the Broodhome.

o DOGIs utilize a momentumless drive system.

o A DOGI attempts to head directly towards an uncloaked enemy ship via the
  shortest route, and will not attempt to avoid asteroids, the planet, other
  DOGIs, Zapsats, marines, hypnotized crew, fighters or projectiles.  However,
  it will attempt to move out of the line of fire of an enemy's primary (B
  button) weapon.

o DOGIs will draw energy only from the enemy ship, and will ignore everything
  else.

o A DOGI will draw 10 points of energy from an enemy ship per attack.

o On contact, a DOGI will bounce off of asteroids, the planet, other DOGIs, and
  marines.

o On contact, a DOGI will destroy hypnotized crew and fighters.  When this
  happens, the DOGI is not affected.

o The shields of the Utwig Jugger and Yehat Terminator cannot protect those
  ships from energy loss caused by contact with DOGIs.

o A DOGI can be destroyed if hit with 3 points of damage.  This can include
  touching the planet.

o DOGIs are not slowed by VUX limpet parasites.  (On contact, a parasite is
  destroyed.)

o DOGIs do not run out of energy, and will not return to the Broodhome.

o Occasionally a DOGI will halt in place while it attempts to sense and track
  the enemy ship.  If the enemy is also stationary, a halted DOGI will remain
  in place until the enemy moves, or the DOGI is pushed by something.

o On generally rare occasions, two DOGIs in contact with each other can lock
  together, and neither will be able to break away under its own power.

o DOGIs are not affected by gravity.

<b>12. CHMMR AVATAR
================</b>
o Combat value is 30.  Starts with 42 crew, 42 energy points.

o The Chmmr Avatar will arrive in the combat zone with 3 Zapsats.  The Zapsats
  are in a fixed orbit, moving clockwise around the ship at 120-degree
  intervals, and at a speed synchronized to the Chmmr's turning rate.  The
  Zapsats will maintain this orbit indefinitely unless they are destroyed, or
  the host Chmmr is physically separated from them.

o Laser weapon detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 2 energy points to
  fire.  Can fire 21 times in a row at the highest repeat rate (continuous
  fire) if energy is at maximum.  Minimal, flash-use of the laser does 2 points
  of damage.

o The Chmmr main laser beam is a non-homing projectile.

o Tractor field detail: Activated with the C button.  Costs 1 energy point to
  use.  Can be used 42 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if energy is
  at maximum.

o The tractor field originates in front of the Chmmr ship, at a point which
  overlaps the outer edge of the Zapsat orbital path, and can instantly affect
  an enemy ship at any range in any direction.

o The tractor field can only affect an uncloaked enemy ship; it has no effect
  on asteroids, the planet, DOGIs, Zapsats, marines, hypnotized crew, fighters
  or projectiles.

o The tractor field cannot affect a cloaked Ilwrath Avenger.

o Under normal circumstances, the Chmmr tractor field cannot move an
  Ariloulaleelay Skiff or a Slylandro Probe.  However, if either of those
  target ships have acquired VUX limpet parasites, they can be affected.  The
  more parasites on the target ship, the greater the effect of the tractor
  field.  Note, however, that the Arilou can only be affected while it is
  thrusting.

o On occasion, use of the tractor field may cause a reduction in a target
  ship's drive capacity.  (This is an effect that lasts even after the field is
  deactivated.)  The target ship can recover by thrusting in a different
  direction.

o The shields of the Utwig Jugger and Yehat Terminator cannot protect those
  ships from the effects of the tractor field.

o If the tractor field is continually employed against an enemy ship (other
  than the Ariloulaleelay Skiff or Slylandro Probe), that ship can potentially
  achieve orbit around the Chmmr.

o If the Chmmr is moving at extreme speeds, it may pull away from its own
  Zapsats.

o Chmmr captain names: Bzztrm, Chzrmn, Frnkzk, Kztztz, Kzzrn, Mnzgk, Mrnkzt,
  Prmtzz, Qrntz, Rmnzk, Szmrnz, Tzrtzn, Tzzqrn, Vzrzn, Zbzzn, Zrnzrk.

<b>13. CHMMR ZAPSAT
================</b>
o The Chmmr Avatar will arrive in the combat zone with 3 Zapsats.  The Zapsats
  are in a fixed orbit, moving clockwise around the ship at 120-degree
  intervals, and at a speed synchronized to the Chmmr's turning rate.  The
  Zapsats will maintain this orbit indefinitely unless they are destroyed, or
  the host Chmmr is physically separated from them.

o If the Chmmr is moving at extreme speeds, it may pull away from its own
  Zapsats.  If this happens, the Zapsats will chase the Chmmr while maintaining
  a distorted orbital pattern.  At all times they remain capable of firing on
  appropriate targets of opportunity.

o A Zapsat can move over an asteroid, planet or ship (except an Androsynth
  Guardian in Blazer mode) without touching it.

o A Zapsat will fire on most objects and projectiles, with the exception of
  asteroids, the planet, the host Chmmr's main laser beam and tractor field,
  beams from friendly Zapsats, an enemy Chmmr's tractor field, a cloaked
  Ilwrath Avenger, the Slylandro energizer, the Syreen Song, hypnotized crew,
  or the explosion caused by the Shofixti Glory Device.

o The Zapsat laser beam is considered a homing projectile, here.

o A Zapsat's beam will do 1 point of damage per hit.

o A Zapsat will only fire on 1 object at a time.

o A Zapsat is destroyed if hit with 10 points of damage, or if it is touched by
  a Kohr-Ah plasmoid (which normally does 3 points of damage).

o A Zapsat will be damaged or destroyed on contact with a Melnorme plasmoid.
  This can also happen without direct contact.  Specifically, the Zapsat must
  pass over the forward half of the Melnorme's hull while the ship is charging
  a plasmoid.  When this happens with a level 4/red plasmoid, the plasmoid
  remains unaffected and the Zapsat is destroyed.  When this happens with
  lesser plasmoids, the plasmoid discharges and the Zapsat takes damage equal
  to that plasmoid's Damage Potential (2, 4 or 8 points).

<b>14. DRUUGE MAULER
=================</b>
o Combat value is 17.  Starts with 14 crew, 32 energy points.

o Cannon detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 4 energy points to fire.
  Can fire 8 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if energy is at maximum
  (barring simultaneous recharging).  A hit does 6 points of damage.

o The Druuge cannon shell is a non-homing "missile" projectile.

o The counterthrust from the cannon's recoil after 1 firing is equal to 120% of
  the Druuge's maximum forward thrust speed.  This same energy is imparted to
  enemy ships which are hit by a cannon shell.

o From a full stop, the Druuge can attain maximum reverse speed with 4 cannon
  firings.  From full-speed forward motion, the Druuge can attain maximum
  reverse speed with 5 cannon firings.

o The counterthrust potential of the cannon is not affected by VUX limpet
  parasites.

o Under normal circumstances, the impact of a Druuge cannon shell will not
  affect the motion of a Slylandro Probe (provided the Slylandro survives the
  impact).  However, if the Slylandro has acquired VUX limpet parasites, it can
  be affected.  The more parasites on the Slylandro, the greater its
  susceptibility to the change in inertia caused by the impact of a cannon
  shell.

o Crew-to-energy conversion detail: Activated with the C button.  Converts 1
  crew member to 16 energy points.  Last crew member cannot be converted.

o Druuge captain names: Biitur, Duulard, Faazur, Feezo, Juugl, Kaapo, Kooli,
  Maad, Moola, Paato, Peeru, Piini, Siinur, Soopi, Tuuga, Zooto.

<b>15. EARTHLING CRUISER
=====================</b>
o Combat value is 11.  Starts with 18 crew, 18 energy points.

o Missile launcher detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 9 energy points
  to fire.  Can fire 2 MX missiles in a row at the highest repeat rate if
  energy is at maximum.  A hit does 4 points of damage.

o The Earthling missile is a homing projectile.

o Point-defense laser system detail: Activated with the C button.  Costs 4
  energy points to fire.  Can fire 5 times in a row at the highest repeat rate
  if energy is at maximum.  A hit does 1 point of damage per beam.

o The Earthling laser beam is considered a homing projectile, here.

o Laser energy emanates from a point at the center of the ship, and its average
  maximum range is just over 2 times the total length of the ship.  The defense
  system will not release a beam unless it detects a target within this range.

o Laser beams will simultaneously strike at all objects and projectiles within
  range, with the exception of the planet, the Chmmr tractor field, a cloaked
  Ilwrath Avenger, the Shofixti Divine Wind, the Slylandro energizer, and the
  Syreen Song.  Note that the defense system can target and fire on the
  Cruiser's own missiles, but may or may not destroy them.  (Specifically, if
  the missile was launched before the defense system was activated, the missile
  will be destroyed if hit.  However, if the defense system is already active
  as the missile is being launched, the missile will not be affected if hit.)

o Each laser beam released by the defense system will be focused on its
  intended target, and will not project past or through intervening objects or
  the target itself.

o A single use of the defense system will never cost more than 4 energy points,
  regardless of how many laser beams are released at the time of firing.

o The version of the Earthling Cruiser that appears in this game varies
  slightly from the version that appeared in earlier Star Control games.  (The
  point-defense laser system can no longer select the planet as a target.)

<b>16. ILWRATH AVENGER
===================</b>
o Combat value is 10.  Starts with 22 crew, 16 energy points.

o HellFire Blast detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 1 energy point to
  fire.  Can fire 16 times in a row at the highest repeat rate (continuous
  fire) if energy is at maximum.  The weapon fires a series of overlapping
  bursts of flame, each burst doing 1 point of damage.

o The Ilwrath flame burst is considered a non-homing "missile" projectile,
  here.

o Firing will deactivate the cloaking device.  It will remain deactivated until
  the C button is hit again.

o If the Ilwrath fires when cloaked, it will always uncloak facing towards the
  enemy ship (provided no object is preventing the Ilwrath from facing that
  direction).  The Ilwrath will even "find" another cloaked Ilwrath this way.

o When an Ilwrath fires while cloaked, the first flame burst released will
  usually be moving directly towards the enemy ship.  Note that this flame
  burst itself is not considered a homing projectile, as its motion is still
  determined by the Ilwrath's heading at the time of launch.

o Cloaking device detail: Activated with the C button; primarily deactivated
  with the C button, but will also deactivate if the Ilwrath fires while
  cloaked.  Costs 3 energy points to toggle on or off with the C button.  No
  energy is used to uncloak when uncloaking is caused by firing (however the
  Hellfire weapon uses a minimum of 1 energy point).  Can maintain a constant
  rate of use if energy is at maximum.

o Generally, the cloak only truly conceals the direction the ship is facing,
  and the ship's thrust trail.  The Ilwrath's position, speed and direction of
  flight can still be computed, because the combat screen view adjusts to keep
  each ship in the exact inverted location of the other ship at all times.  A
  cloaked Ilwrath can counter this disclosure of position only when combatting
  another cloaked Ilwrath.

o The cloak absorbs light instead of bending it, so the ship will still blot
  out any stars it passes over.  The Ilwrath's silhouette may also be glimpsed
  in Earthling missile explosions against its hull.

o DOGIs, Zapsats, marines, fighters, and homing weapons and projectiles are
  unable to track the Ilwrath when it is cloaked.  (DOGIs, Androsynth bubbles
  and placed Kohr-Ah mines will remain in a limited area, fighters and marines
  will attempt to return to their host ships, and other homing projectiles will
  proceed along a straight path.  If the Ilwrath uncloaks again, DOGIs,
  Zapsats, fighters and homing projectiles may continue to track the Ilwrath,
  but marines will continue to return to their host ship.)

o Ilwrath captain names: Argarak, Baylor, Borgo, Dirga, Gorgon, Kalgon, Kayzar,
  Lurgo, Manglor, Regorjo, Rogash, Slygor, Taragon, Targa, Vogar, Zoggak.

<b>17. KOHR-AH MARAUDER
====================</b>
o Combat value is 30.  Starts with 42 crew, 42 energy points.

o Mine launcher detail: Activated with the B button, held down for a variable
  time before release.  Costs 6 energy points to fire.  Can fire 8 times in a
  row at the highest repeat rate if energy is at maximum.  A hit does 4 points
  of damage.

o The Kohr-Ah mine during launch is a non-homing "missile" projectile.  The
  Kohr-Ah mine after placement is a homing "missile" projectile.

o While launching, a mine will travel indefinitely until the B button is
  released, the mine is destroyed in a collision, or the launching Kohr-Ah is
  destroyed (causing the mine to halt in place).  If the mine goes off the edge
  of the screen, it can eventually "wrap around", approaching from the opposite
  edge.  If the mine reaches the launching Kohr-Ah, it will pass overhead,
  doing no damage.

o While a mine is being launched (before the B button is released) its course
  can be affected by gravity.  After a mine is placed, gravity will no longer
  affect it.

o Each Kohr-Ah can have up to 8 mines deployed at one time.  (As a ninth mine
  is launched, the first/oldest mine already in place will disappear, returning
  the total to 8.)

o Once a mine is placed it will remain in place until it is destroyed, removed
  to create a new mine, or until an uncloaked enemy ship comes near it.

o When an uncloaked enemy ship approaches a mine (from a distance of about 12
  mine-diameters or less), the mine will begin to move towards the ship.  If
  the ship then moves out of the mine's tracking range, cloaks, or is destroyed
  by another force, the mine will halt in place.

o Plasmoid ring detail: Activated with the C button.  Costs 21 energy points to
  activate.  Can be activated 2 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if
  energy is at maximum.  The defense system releases a ring of 16 plasmoids
  from the core of the ship (360 degrees at 22.5-degree intervals).  Each of
  these plasmoids can do 3 points of damage to an enemy ship.

o The Kohr-Ah plasmoid is a non-homing "missile" projectile.

o A Kohr-Ah plasmoid will destroy asteroids, DOGIs, Zapsats, marines,
  hypnotized crew, fighters, all beam projectiles and most missile projectiles
  on contact.  A Kohr-Ah plasmoid will have no effect on most field
  projectiles.

o The only projectile that can destroy a Kohr-Ah plasmoid is an enemy Kohr-Ah's
  plasmoid.  (Both disappear on contact.)

o Plasmoids can be affected by gravity.

o Mines and plasmoids from the same Kohr-Ah will not affect each other.

o Kohr-Ah captain names: Death 3, Death 5, Death 7, Death 11, Death 13, Death
  17, Death 19, Death 23, Death 29, Death 31, Death 37, Death 41, Death 43,
  Death 47, Death 53, Death 83.

<b>18. MELNORME TRADER
===================</b>
o Combat value is 18.  Starts with 20 crew, 42 energy points.

o Plasma weapon detail: Activated with the B button, held down for a variable
  time before release.  Costs 5 energy points to form a plasmoid.  Once formed,
  costs no further energy points (per se) to hold and charge.  Can fire 8 times
  in a row at the highest repeat rate if energy is at maximum.  The primary,
  minimally-charged green plasmoid does 2 points of damage.  About every 2.9
  seconds of charge time, the plasmoid will increase in size and double in
  strength, changing color each time.  With continued charging, a plasmoid will
  change from a green color and a 2-point Damage Potential to blue and 4
  points, then to purple and 8 points, and finally to red and 16 points.
  Additional charging beyond this point will have no new effect.

o The Melnorme plasmoid while charging is considered a "field" projectile,
  here.  The Melnorme plasmoid during launch is a non-homing "missile"
  projectile.

o A Melnorme will not regenerate energy while a plasmoid is charging.

o If a charging plasmoid is touched by an asteroid, the planet, a ship, DOGI,
  or marine, the plasmoid discharges.  If this happens, a new plasmoid will
  automatically take its place (provided that the plasma weapon system remains
  activated and the Melnorme has at least 5 energy points available).

o A Zapsat will be damaged or destroyed on contact with a Melnorme plasmoid.
  This can also happen without direct contact.  Specifically, the Zapsat must
  pass over the forward half of the Melnorme's hull while the ship is charging
  a plasmoid.  When this happens with a level 4/red plasmoid, the plasmoid
  remains unaffected and the Zapsat is destroyed.  When this happens with
  lesser plasmoids, the plasmoid discharges and the Zapsat takes damage equal
  to that plasmoid's Damage Potential (2, 4 or 8 points).

o Unlike other projectiles, a charging Melnorme plasmoid cannot accumulate
  damage.  In other words, if one projectile of a given type and strength
  cannot instantly destroy a charging plasmoid on contact, then no number of
  identical projectiles will affect that plasmoid for as long as it is held by
  the Melnorme.  Note that as a charging plasmoid gains power, there will be
  fewer and fewer projectiles capable of destroying it.

o The only projectiles that can destroy a level 4/red plasmoid held by a
  Melnorme Trader are the Kohr-Ah plasmoid, and another red plasmoid being held
  by an enemy Melnorme.

o In general, if a charging plasmoid survives contact with an incoming
  projectile, the incoming projectile is destroyed.  In this way, a charging
  plasmoid (especially at higher power levels) can be used as a forward shield
  by the Melnorme.  However, there are a few instances where this shielding
  effect will not work.  Specifically, most field projectiles are unaffected by
  all other weapons, and therefore cannot be blocked (most enemy fields will
  penetrate, overlay, or push aside a charging plasmoid).  Also, many laser
  weapons at close range can occasionally punch through a charging plasmoid
  (although the plasmoid remains unaffected).  Finally, the EM "confusion"
  pulse from any Melnorme can move through any charging plasmoid (and neither
  projectile will be affected).

o If the Melnorme is destroyed while its plasmoid is charging, the plasmoid
  will be released.

o Once launched, a plasmoid's course can be affected by gravity.

o Electromagnetic (EM) "confusion" pulse cannon detail: Activated with the C
  button.  Costs 20 energy points to fire.  Can fire 2 times in a row at the
  highest repeat rate if energy is at maximum.  A hit does no direct damage to
  the crew of an enemy ship.

o The Melnorme EM pulse is a non-homing "missile" projectile.

o An EM pulse will not affect asteroids, the planet, DOGIs, Zapsats, marines,
  hypnotized crew, fighters or projectiles.  The pulse in turn cannot be
  affected by any other object or projectile.  The EM pulse is the only missile
  projectile that can be fired directly through asteroids and planets.

o When a ship is hit with an EM pulse, it will spin clockwise or
  counterclockwise (the direction is chosen at random).  The duration of the
  confusion effect is about 15.8 seconds of game time.  The number of times a
  ship will rotate varies from ship type to ship type, but remains a constant
  within a type.  For example, an Earthling Cruiser will always rotate 12.5
  times (assuming no additional outside influences), while under the same
  circumstances a Kohr-Ah Marauder will always rotate exactly 5 times.

o The shields of the Utwig Jugger and Yehat Terminator cannot protect those
  ships from the effects of an EM pulse.

o Melnorme captain names: Aqua, Beige, Black, Bluish, Cerise, Cheruse, Crimson,
  Fuchsia, Grayish, Magenta, Mauve, Orangy, Purple, Reddish, Umber, Yellow.

<b>19. MMRNMHRM TRANSFORMER
========================</b>
o This ship is also known as the Mmrnmhrm Xform (or X-form).

o Combat value is 19.  Starts with 20 crew, 10 energy points.

o First form ("X wing") detail: Low speed, fast turning rate, fast recharging
  rate, short-range weapon (twin lasers).  Traits are inverted from the Second
  form ("Y wing").

o Laser weapon detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 1 energy point to
  fire.  Can fire 10 pairs of beams in a row at the highest repeat rate
  (continuous fire) if energy is at maximum.  Minimal, flash-use of the laser
  does 1 point of damage per beam.

o The Mmrnmhrm laser beam is a non-homing projectile.

o When the lasers are fired, 2 beams are released, one each from nacelles
  located on the wing tips.  The beams converge on a point ahead of the
  Mmrnmhrm.  (The average maximum range of each beam is just over 7 times the
  total length of the ship.)

o Second form ("Y wing") detail: High speed, slow turning rate, slow recharging
  rate, long-range weapon (twin missiles).  Traits are inverted from the First
  form ("X wing").

o Missile weapon detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 1 energy point to
  fire.  Can maintain a constant rate of fire (the Mmrnmhrm generates energy
  faster than the missile weapon consumes it).  The two missiles do 1 point of
  damage apiece.

o The Mmrnmhrm missile is a homing projectile.

o When missiles are fired, 2 missiles are launched, one each from tubes located
  against the port and starboard sides of the hull, just behind the nose of the
  ship.  The tubes launch missiles across the nose of the ship, and at an angle
  of about 30 degrees from forward.

o The Mmrnmhrm in Second form can actually gain energy while maintaining a
  constant rate of fire.  Under normal circumstances, it is the only ship that
  can do this.

o Transformation detail: Activated with the C button.  Costs (all) 10 energy
  points to use.  Can transform only once without recharging.

o A Mmrnmhrm cannot transform if an object is occupying the space that the new
  shape must occupy.  For example, if an asteroid is in direct contact with the
  aft of the First form's hull, the Second form's "tail" has no room to form,
  and therefore transformation will not occur.

o The Mmrnmhrm always enters the combat area in First form (hence the term).

o The Mmrnmhrm in First form regenerates energy twice as fast as the Second
  form.

o Mmrnmhrm captain names: Hm-nhuh, Hmr-hun, Hrnm-hm, Jhe-mhr, Jhe-qir, Jra-nr,
  Mn-quah, Mrm-na, Nhuh-na, Nrna-mha, Qir-nha, Qua-qir, Qua-rhna, Rrma-hrn,

<b>20. MYCON PODSHIP
=================</b>
o Combat value is 21.  Starts with 20 crew, 40 energy points.

o Homing plasmoid detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 20 energy points
  to fire.  Can fire 2 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if energy is
  at maximum.  The plasmoid decays over 11 stages: Upon firing, a hit at
  point-blank range does 10 points of damage, and each successive stage does
  about one point less damage than the previous, until the final stage, which
  does 1 point of damage.

o The Mycon plasmoid is a homing "missile" projectile.

o If a plasmoid is launched forward while the Podship is moving faster than its
  standard maximum speed and/or the launching port is facing away from the
  enemy ship, the Podship may hit itself.

o Crew regeneration detail: Activated with the C button.  Costs (all) 40 energy
  points.  Can regenerate crew only once without recharging.

o 4 crew are regenerated at a time, up to the maximum crew capacity of the
  ship.

o Mycon captain names: Blort, Chupp, Floos, Glish, Glob, Glush, Plork, Shlish,
  Shlupp, Slingy, Sploozo, Spork, Uffo, Yush, Zaloop, Znuff.

<b>21. ORZ NEMESIS
===============</b>
o Combat value is 23.  Starts with 16 crew, 20 energy points.

o Howitzer detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 6 energy points to fire.
  Can fire 3 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if energy is at maximum.
  A hit does 3 points of damage.

o The Orz howitzer shell is a non-homing "missile" projectile.

o Howitzer turret rotation is activated with the left and right arrows on the
  D button while the C button is held down.

o The howitzer turret can rotate through 16 orientations (360 degrees at
  22.5-degree intervals).  These firing angles are identical to the 16 possible
  ship hull orientations.

o Orz Nemesis icons used throughout the game depict the ship's howitzer facing
  backwards.  However, when the ship enters the combat zone, its howitzer will
  be facing forward.

o The howitzer turret pivots half as fast as the ship itself can.  (The turret
  can complete one rotational cycle about every 2.35 seconds.)

o VUX limpet parasites will not slow the rotation speed of the howitzer turret.

o Marine launch detail: Activated with the B button while the C button is held
  down.  Costs 0 energy points to release a marine.  A Nemesis can have up to 8
  marines active at a time.  A marine will do a minimum of 1 point of damage
  upon entering an enemy ship.

o When a marine is released, it appears immediately aft of the Nemesis.  When
  the enemy ship is cloaked or destroyed, the marine can return to the Nemesis
  through any part of its hull.

o If the enemy ship is cloaked or destroyed, the Nemesis will be unable to
  launch a marine.

o A Nemesis' howitzer shells will not affect its own marines.

o The Orz cannot turn while rotating the howitzer turret or launching marines.

o An Orz Nemesis under Weak Cyborg control cannot rotate the howitzer turret or
  launch marines.

o Orz captain names: Camper, Dancer, Deep, FatFun, Frumple, Happy, Heavy,
  Hungry, Juice, Loner, NewBoy, Pepper, Singer, Smell, Squirt, Wet.

<a name="22"></a>
<b>22. ORZ MARINE
==============</b>
o When a marine is released, it appears immediately aft of the Nemesis.  When
  the enemy ship is cloaked or destroyed, the marine can return to the Nemesis
  through any part of its hull.

o Upon release, a marine attempts to head directly towards an uncloaked enemy
  ship via the shortest route, and will not attempt to avoid asteroids, DOGIs,
  Zapsats, other marines, hypnotized crew, fighters or projectiles.  A marine
  will attempt to avoid the planet when possible.

o On contact, a marine will bounce off of asteroids, DOGIs, enemy marines, a
  shielded Utwig Jugger, and a shielded Yehat Terminator.  When these
  collisions happen, the object touched by the marine may also be moved/
  deflected.

o In general, marines cannot enter the Androsynth Guardian while it is in
  Blazer form (the marine is usually destroyed, and the Androsynth may be
  deflected slightly).  However, if several marines touch the hull
  simultaneously, a boarding can occur.

o On contact, a marine will destroy hypnotized crew and fighters.  When this
  happens, the marine is not affected.

o An Orz marine will pursue an uncloaked enemy ship until the launching
  Nemesis, the enemy ship, or the marine itself is destroyed, or the enemy ship
  cloaks.

o If a ship is boarded by an enemy Orz marine, a marine icon appears on the top
  half of that ship's status display.  Up to 8 marine icons can appear on a
  status display, echoing the maximum number of enemy marines which can be
  aboard a ship at one time.  If a marine fires on the ship's crew, the icon
  representing that marine will flash.  If the marine is destroyed, its icon
  will disappear from the status display.

o A marine will do a minimum of 1 point of damage upon entering an enemy ship.
  The marine may continue to kill enemy crew members one at a time (at random
  intervals), until the enemy ship, or the marine itself is destroyed.

o The marine's laser is considered a homing projectile, here.

o A marine in space can be destroyed if it touches the planet, or if it is hit
  with 3 points of damage.  A marine inside an enemy ship can be destroyed at
  any time, so long as the enemy ship had at least 2 crew at the time the
  marine entered.  (Note that a marine aboard an enemy ship is either active or
  fully destroyed; it cannot accumulate non-fatal damage here.)

o A Nemesis' howitzer shells will not affect its own marines.

o A damaged marine will remain damaged until it is destroyed or it returns to
  the launching Nemesis.  Upon return to the Nemesis, a marine returns to an
  undamaged state.

o Marines are not slowed by VUX limpet parasites.  (On contact, a parasite is
  destroyed.)

o If a Shofixti Scout self-destructs, any marines near the Shofixti's hull will
  be destroyed.  Any marines that were inside the Shofixti will survive the
  explosion.

o The shields of the Utwig Jugger and Yehat Terminator cannot protect those
  ships from the internal attacks from Orz marines.

o Marines do not run out of energy, and will not return to the Nemesis unless
  the enemy ship is cloaked (before being boarded), or until the enemy ship is
  destroyed.

o Frequently, a marine will exit an exploding enemy ship along same path and
  trajectory that was used to enter the ship.  For example, a marine coming
  from the top of the screen is moving south as it enters an enemy ship; If
  that ship is then destroyed, the marine will likely begin moving south out of
  the fireball.  (Note that the marine will choose this path even if the enemy
  ship has moved and/or rotated the hull since the marine entered.)  From there
  the marine will attempt course corrections as necessary to return to the
  launching Nemesis.

o While an Orz marine is returning to the launching Nemesis, it will ignore any
  new enemy ship that enters the combat zone.  (On contact with an enemy ship,
  a returning marine will pass overhead, doing no damage.)

o When a marine is chasing an enemy ship, it will be red and yellow in color.
  When a marine is returning from an enemy ship, it will usually be green in
  color, but may occasionally retain its red/yellow "attack" coloring.

o On generally rare occasions, a marine will circle a stationary or slow-moving
  target without entering it.  (Specifically, a marine using thrust is unable
  to turn sharply enough towards the target to counter the momentum which is
  carrying it past the target.  This balance of momentum and course-correcting
  thrust essentially keeps the marine in orbit around the target.  However, if
  the target ship thrusts, or some external force acts upon the target ship or
  marine, that balance may be lost, which will then likely allow the marine to
  board.)

<b>23. PKUNK FURY
==============</b>
o Combat value is 20.  Starts with 8 crew, 12 energy points.

o Multigun detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 1 energy point to fire.
  Can fire 12 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if energy is at maximum
  (barring simultaneous recharging).  Minimal, flash-use of the weapon releases
  3 mass pellets, a hit doing 1 point of damage per pellet.

o The Pkunk mass pellet is a non-homing "missile" projectile.

o Projectiles are simultaneously fired directly forward from the nose of the
  ship, and from the center of the port and starboard edges, at 90 degrees from
  forward.

o Energy generation detail: Activated with the C button.  Pressing and
  releasing the C button once will regenerate 2 points of energy.  By holding
  the C button down, the Pkunk can regenerate energy from a zero energy level
  to maximum capacity in about 3.5 seconds of game time (barring any
  simultaneous energy consumption).

o A Pkunk Fury under Weak Cyborg control can still use its recharge ("C
  button") function.

o When a Pkunk reincarnates, the new ship will have full energy and a full
  complement of new crew members (including the same captain), and will appear
  in a random location, facing a random direction.

o A Pkunk Fury under Weak Cyborg control will never reincarnate.  A Pkunk under
  any other control averages a 50% chance of reincarnation.

o If a Pkunk is destroyed by the self-destruction (Glory Device) of a Shofixti
  Scout, the Shofixti victory music may be played even if the Pkunk ship
  reincarnates.

o The Pkunk has the fastest standard forward thrust speed of all ships.

<b>24. SHOFIXTI SCOUT
==================</b>
o Combat value is 5.  Starts with 6 crew, 4 energy points.

o Energy dart launcher detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 1 energy
  point to fire.  Can fire 4 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if
  energy is at maximum.  A hit does 1 point of damage.

o The Shofixti energy dart is a non-homing "missile" projectile.

o Glory Device detail: Activated with the C button (must be pressed 3 times to
  detonate).  Costs no energy points to arm; costs all energy points and all
  crew to destruct.  Can be used once.  Self-destructing is only effective at
  short range; It is ineffective against enemy ships at ranges where the combat
  screen is zoomed the way out.  The closer a target is, the more effective the
  explosion will be.  At zero range, the explosion will do a maximum of 18
  points of damage to an enemy ship.

o The Shofixti "Divine Wind" (the explosion caused by self-destruction) is
  considered a "field" projectile, here.

o Any damage to an enemy ship as a result of self-destructing will occur at the
  moment the explosion is triggered.  By the time the explosion itself develops
  on the screen, the damage, if any, has already been inflicted.

o Self-destructing can also destroy asteroids, DOGIs, Zapsats, marines,
  hypnotized crew, fighters and projectiles.

o If a Shofixti Scout self-destructs, any marines near the Shofixti's hull will
  be destroyed.  Any marines that were inside the Shofixti will survive the
  explosion.

o The shields of the Utwig Jugger and Yehat Terminator cannot protect those
  ships from damage caused by the Glory Device.

o Shofixti captain names: Bonsai!, Busu, Chimchim, Daikon, Gaijin, Genjiro,
  Ginzu, Hiyata, Ichiban, Kimba, Kudzu, Naninani, Sushi, Tofu, Tora-3, Wasabe.

o The version of the Shofixti Scout that appears in this game varies slightly
  from the version that appeared in earlier Star Control games.  (Previously,
  the explosion caused by self destruction did not affect asteroids, DOGIs,
  hypnotized crew, fighters or projectiles.)

<b>25. SLYLANDRO PROBE
===================</b>
o Combat value is 17.  Starts with 12 crew, 20 energy points.

o The Slylandro utilizes a momentumless drive system.

o A Slylandro's direction of travel is reversed with the A button.

o Lightning weapon detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 2 energy points
  to fire.  Can be fired 10 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if energy
  is at maximum (barring simultaneous recharging).

o The Slylandro lightning bolt is considered a homing "beam" projectile, here.

o Energizer (asteroid converter field) detail: Activated with the C button.
  Costs 0 energy points to activate.  Can maintain a constant rate of use
  (within a timed cycle of about 1 pulse per .75 seconds), regardless of the
  Slylandro's energy status.  A hit will destroy all asteroids within range;
  Nothing else in the combat area is affected.

o Energizer field emanates from the core of the ship, and its average maximum
  range is just over 2 times the total length of the ship.  The energizer
  system will not activate unless it senses an asteroid within this range.

o The energizer will simultaneously strike all asteroids within range.  When an
  asteroid is sacked (drained of energy and destroyed), the Slylandro instantly
  attains a maximum energy level (20 points).

o Gravity will usually have no effect on a Slylandro Probe, and under normal
  circumstances a Slylandro cannot gain or lose speed by moving through a
  planet's gravity field, cannot achieve orbit, and cannot be pulled to a
  planet's surface.  However, if a Slylandro acquires several limpet parasites,
  it will begin to succumb to gravity when it maneuvers near the planet.

o Under normal circumstances, the Chmmr Avatar's tractor field cannot move a
  Slylandro Probe.  However, if a Slylandro has acquired VUX limpet parasites,
  it can be affected.  The more parasites on the Slylandro, the greater the
  effect of the tractor field.

o The Slylandro Probe's "inert" crew is able to repel internal attack from Orz
  marines.  (In this attribute the Slylandro's crew is identical to that of all
  other ships.)

o The Syreen Song will have no effect on a Slylandro.

o A Slylandro Probe cannot retrieve hypnotized crew.  (A damaged Slylandro
  cannot retrieve non-Slylandro crew.)

o If a Slylandro collides with an asteroid or an enemy ship, there is a chance
  that both objects will interlock and freeze in place.  The Slylandro can free
  itself by reversing course, by using the energizer (against an asteroid), or,
  in some cases, by using the lightning weapon.

o If a Slylandro collides with the planet, there is a chance that the ship will
  remain fixed in place against the planet.  If this happens, the Slylandro
  will be destroyed unless the A button is pressed to reverse course.

o A Slylandro Probe under Weak Cyborg control can still use its recharge ("C
  button") function.

o Slylandro captain name equivalent: 2418-B.

<b>26. SPATHI ELUDER
=================</b>
o This ship is also known as the Spathi Discriminator.

o Combat value is 18.  Starts with 30 crew, 10 energy points.

o Forward weapon detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 2 energy points to
  fire.  Can fire 5 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if energy is at
  maximum.  A hit does 1 point of damage.

o The Spathi forward shot is a non-homing "missile" projectile.

o Backwards Utilizing Tracking Torpedo (BUTT) detail: Activated with the C
  button.  Costs 3 energy points to fire.  Can fire 3 times in a row at the
  highest repeat rate if energy is at maximum.  A hit does 2 points of damage.

o The Spathi BUTT is a homing "missile" projectile.

o Torpedoes travel slower than the Spathi's top speed.  Firing a torpedo with
  the BUTT weapon facing forward can lead to the ship hitting itself.

o Forward shots and torpedoes from the same Spathi will destroy each other on
  contact.

o Spathi captain names: Bwinkin, Jinkeze, Kwimp, Nargle, Phlendo, Phwiff,

o Globule weapon detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 1 energy point to
  fire.  Can be fired 16 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if energy is
  at maximum.  A hit does 1 point of damage.

o The Supox caustic globule is a non-homing "missile" projectile.

o Extended maneuvering detail: Activated with the C button while the A button
  is held down, or the left, right or up arrow on the D button while the C
  button is held down.  Maneuvering (in any direction) costs no energy points.

o The Supox has the same maximum thrust speed in any direction.  (Specifically,
  forward thrust, side thrust and reverse thrust, individually and in all
  functional combinations, are equal.)

o The Supox cannot turn while thrusting in a non-forward direction.

<b>28. SYREEN PENETRATOR
=====================</b>
o Combat value is 13.  Starts with 12 crew (total capacity of 42 crew), 16
  energy points.

o Electron dagger weapon detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 1 energy
  point to fire.  Can maintain a constant rate of fire (the Syreen generates
  energy as quickly as the electron weapon consumes it).  A hit does 2 points
  of damage.

o The Syreen electron dagger is a non-homing "missile" projectile.

o Song weapon detail: Activated with the C button.  Costs 5 energy points to
  use.  Can use 5 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if energy is at
  maximum.  The Song will be ineffective against enemy ships at ranges where
  the combat screen is zoomed all the way out.  The closer the two ships are,
  the more effective it will be.  At minimal range, the Song can pull a maximum
  of 8 crew at a time from an enemy ship.

o In this document, the term "hypnotized crew" refers to crew members which
  have been called into space by the Song weapon of the Syreen Penetrator.

o The Syreen Song is considered a "field" projectile, here.

o The Song weapon only affects enemy ships (with the exception of the Slylandro
  Probe); it has no effect on asteroids, the planet, DOGIs, Zapsats, marines,
  hypnotized crew (using the Song twice won't make them approach faster, etc.),
  fighters or projectiles.

o The Song weapon will not affect the course of the Syreen's own crew if the
  crew has been called into space by an enemy Syreen.

o The Song weapon can draw all but the last crew member from an enemy ship.
  (The Song will have no effect on a target carrying less than 2 crew.)

o The Song weapon is able to pull crew from an Utwig Jugger or Yehat Terminator
  through their shields.  An Utwig or Yehat can also retrieve hypnotized crew
  with their shields on.

o Regardless of relative ship positions, crew will often leave an enemy ship
  from whichever side is facing the bottom of the screen (south) at the time.

o An enemy Mycon Podship or Pkunk Fury can potentially provide the largest
  number of crew members to an attacking Syreen.  (The Mycon can generate new
  crew members indefinitely, and a Pkunk brings 7 susceptible crew members into
  the combat zone each time it reincarnates.)

o Syreen captain names: Aelita, Alia, Alura, Ardala, Be'lit, Brawne, Dale,
  Danning, Dejah, Maya, Munro, Penny, Ripley, Sparta, Teela, Yarr.

<b>29. HYPNOTIZED CREW
===================</b>
o In this document, the term "hypnotized crew" refers to crew members which
  have been called into space by the Song weapon of the Syreen Penetrator.

o Hypnotized crew will last about 12 seconds in space before expiring.

o Hypnotized crew members can be destroyed by all projectiles except the Chmmr
  tractor field, the Melnorme EM "confusion" pulse, the Slylandro energizer,
  the Syreen Song, and VUX limpet parasites.  They can also be destroyed by
  direct contact with any object (with the possible exception of a ship's
  hull), or by running out of time.

o Hypnotized crew will be drawn towards the Syreen ship which called them into
  space.  If that Syreen is destroyed, the crew will move towards the other
  ship.

o Note that hypnotized crew and VUX limpet parasites will both appear as
  flashing green dots on the screen.  Although they may look similar, parasites
  flash less frequently and will generally move faster than hypnotized crew
  members.  When the combat screen is zoomed all the way in, parasites will
  appear larger than hypnotized crew members.

o Hypnotized crew are not slowed by VUX limpet parasites.  (On contact, a
  parasite is destroyed.)

o Hypnotized crew can be affected by gravity.

o Hypnotized crew may be retrieved by all ship types except the Slylandro
  Probe.  Crew may retrieved at any time, and can enter a ship through any part
  of its hull.  Hypnotized crew are not cleared from the combat area until they
  are retrieved or until they expire.  Note that any ship which is already
  crewed to its maximum capacity cannot retrieve more crew from space.  In this
  instance the sound effect for successful crew retrieval is played, but in
  reality they are destroyed.

<b>31. UMGAH DRONE
===============</b>
o Combat value is 7.  Starts with 10 crew, 30 energy points.

o Antimatter cone projector detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs no
  energy points (per se) to fire.  Can maintain continuous firing regardless of
  energy status.  Minimal, flash-use of the antimatter cone does 1 point of
  damage.

o The Umgah antimatter cone is considered a "field" projectile, here.

o The antimatter cone can destroy all beam projectiles, and most missile
  projectiles.

o Reverse jump detail: Activated with the C button.  Costs 1 energy point per
  jump.  Can jump 30 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if energy is at
  maximum.

o The Umgah loses all momentum during reverse jump, and will come to a full
  stop when it's disengaged.

o In reverse jump mode, the Umgah exceeds the standard top speed of all other
  ships.  (Note, however, that the Umgah's maximum forward thrust speed is the
  slowest of all ships.)

o The reverse jump is not affected by VUX limpet parasites.

o The recharging process for the Umgah differs from that of all other ships.
  30 energy points are instantly generated once every 6 seconds.  If the Umgah
  fires or reverse-jumps at any time, or is touched by a DOGI, the 6-second
  timer is reset, and will start again only when the Umgah is not firing,
  jumping, or in contact with a DOGI.

o If an Umgah is facing directly north, and is simultaneously attempting to use
  both its forward thrust and reverse jump, its forward thrust will become
  disabled.  This effect will persist unless/until the Umgah rotates to face a
  different direction, engages reverse jump without thrusting, or is moved by
  an external force.

o Umgah captain names: Baguk'i, Bob, Brewz'k, Chez'ef, Chup'he, Ei'Ei'o,

  Dreadnought.  Each fighter briefly moves away from the end of its pod at
  about a 45-degree angle (launching angle between two fighters is about 90
  degrees), and then attempts to home in on the enemy ship.  When fighters need
  energy and/or the enemy is cloaked or destroyed, they can return to the
  Dreadnought through any part of its hull.

o Usually, 2 fighters are launched at a time.  If only 2 crew remain, then 1
  fighter is launched (last crew member cannot be launched).  When 1 fighter is
  launched, it will always exit from the starboard pod on the Dreadnought.

<b>33. UR-QUAN FIGHTER
===================</b>
o Fighters are launched from the rear of the pods on either side of the
  Dreadnought.  Each fighter briefly moves away from the end of its pod at
  about a 45-degree angle (launching angle between two fighters is about 90
  degrees), and then attempts to home in on the enemy ship.  When fighters need
  energy and/or the enemy is cloaked or destroyed, they can return to the
  Dreadnought through any part of its hull.

o Fighters utilize a momentumless drive system.

o Fighters attempt to head directly towards an uncloaked enemy ship via the
  shortest route, and will not attempt to avoid asteroids, DOGIs, Zapsats,
  marines, hypnotized crew, other fighters or projectiles.  If the planet lies
  immediately in the path of a fighter, the fighter will attempt a series of
  course corrections to navigate around it.  However, fighters may occasionally
  become "stuck" near the surface of the planet while attempting to find a path
  around it.

o A fighter will attempt to move to a flank of the enemy ship when possible.
  Note that a fighter launched from the pod on one side of an Ur-Quan
  Dreadnought will attempt to move to the same side of the enemy ship.

o Fighters will fire only at the enemy ship, and ignore everything else.

o The fighter's laser beam is a homing projectile.

o A fighter can fire more than 40 times if proximity, time and survivability
  permit.

o A hit from a fighter's laser does 1 point of damage.

o A fighter can be destroyed by all enemy projectiles except the Chmmr tractor
  field, the Melnorme EM "confusion" pulse, the Slylandro energizer, the Syreen
  Song and VUX limpet parasites.  They can also be destroyed by direct contact
  with any object (other than the launching Dreadnought), or by running out of
  energy.  A Dreadnought's fusion blast will not affect its own fighters.

o Fighters are not slowed by VUX limpet parasites.  (On contact, a parasite is
  destroyed.)

o At launch, a fighter has about 15.5 seconds of energy.  For about 11 seconds
  of this time it will pursue/attack any uncloaked enemy ship.  When a
  fighter's energy level drops to about 4.5 seconds (and/or the enemy ship has
  cloaked or has been destroyed), it will attempt to return to the host
  Dreadnought via the shortest route.  Again, it will not attempt to navigate
  around most intervening objects, including the enemy ship (although it may
  still fire on an enemy ship if it is encountered along the return path to the
  Dreadnought).  If the host Dreadnought is far away, or it is moving away from
  its fighters, the fighters may not be able to return before expiring.

o Fighters are not affected by gravity.

o The version of the Ur-Quan fighter that appears in this game varies slightly
  from the version that appeared in earlier Star Control games.  (Previously, a
  fighter would never attempt to navigate around the planet.)

o Combat value is 22.  Starts with 20 crew, 10 energy points (total capacity of
  20 energy points).

o Energy spear weapon detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 0 energy
  points to fire.  Can maintain a constant rate of fire regardless of energy
  status.  The 6 spears released do 1 point of damage apiece.

o The Utwig energy spear is a non-homing "missile" projectile.

o Spears launch directly forward from 6 spines arranged along the front edge of
  the ship (2 spines on the port wing, 2 on the nose, 2 on the starboard wing).

o Shield/energy accumulator detail: Activated with the C button.  Costs 1
  energy point to use.  Can use 10 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if
  energy is at maximum (barring simultaneous recharging).

o An Utwig cannot fire while its shield is activated.

o The shield will not damage an enemy ship in contact with it.

o While shielded, the Utwig is still vulnerable to damage from collision with
  the planet, energy loss to DOGIs, and the effects of the Melnorme EM
  "confusion" pulse, Orz marine lasers fired inside the Utwig, the Shofixti
  Glory Device, the Syreen Song, and VUX limpet parasites.  While shielded, the
  Utwig also remains vulnerable to changes in inertia caused by contact with
  asteroids, the planet, other ships, Chenjesu DOGIs, the Chmmr tractor field,
  Druuge cannon shells and Orz marines.  Otherwise, no object or projectile at
  any strength can affect the Utwig through its shield.

o If the Utwig has lost its last energy point, its shield will be permanently
  disabled.

o When the shield is on, the Utwig will accumulate energy if it is struck by
  most enemy projectiles (the exceptions are the Chmmr tractor field, the
  Melnorme EM "confusion" pulse, Orz marine lasers fired inside the Utwig, the
  Shofixti Glory Device, the Slylandro energizer, the Syreen Song, and VUX
  limpet parasites).  The energy accumulated will equal the Damage Potential of
  the projectile.

o If a marine attempts to enter a shielded Utwig, the marine and the ship will
  likely be deflected from one another, and neither will be damaged.

o The Utwig can retrieve hypnotized crew with its shield on.

o Utwig captain names: Duna, Endo, Erog, Frann, Jujuby, Krisk, Lololo, Lurg,
  Manny, Nergo, Nestor, Sami, Snoon, Thory, Uuter, Vermi.

<b>35. VUX INTRUDER
================</b>
o Combat value is 12.  Starts with 20 crew, 40 energy points.

o Optical laser detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 1 energy point to
  fire.  Can fire 40 times in a row at the highest repeat rate (continuous
  fire) if energy is at maximum.  Minimal, flash-use of the laser does 1 point
  of damage.

o The VUX laser beam is a non-homing projectile.

o Limpet parasite launcher detail: Activated with the C button.  Costs 2 energy
  points to launch.  Can launch 20 limpets in a row at the highest repeat rate
  if energy is at maximum.

o The VUX limpet parasite is a homing "missile" projectile.

o Parasites are launched directly forward from just behind the nose of the VUX,
  and home in on any uncloaked enemy ship.

o Note that VUX limpet parasites and hypnotized crew will both appear as
  flashing green dots on the screen.  Although they may look similar, parasites
  flash less frequently and will generally move faster than hypnotized crew
  members.  When the combat screen is zoomed all the way in, parasites will
  appear larger than hypnotized crew members.

o Parasites only affect enemy ships; they have no effect on the launching VUX,
  asteroids, the planet, DOGIs, Zapsats, marines, hypnotized crew, fighters or
  projectiles.

o If a ship acquires an enemy VUX limpet parasite, a parasite appears on the
  ship image in that ship's status display.

o Parasites will affect only the forward thrust and turn rate of an enemy ship.
  They do not affect the Androsynth's Blazer form, the Umgah's reverse jump, or
  the Ariloulaleelay's hyperjump.  (Note that parasites picked up by an
  Androsynth in Blazer form will remain to affect its initial form.)

o Under normal circumstances, the Ariloulaleelay Skiff and Slylandro Probe can
  not be affected by gravity or the Chmmr tractor field.  However, if either of
  these ships has acquired parasites, they can be affected.  The more parasites
  acquired by these ships, the greater their potential susceptibility to those
  forces.

o Parasites will have an equal effect regardless of their placement on a ship's
  hull.

o Although parasites will slow a ship, they cannot reduce a ship's thrust or
  turn rate to absolute zero.

o The shields of the Utwig Jugger and Yehat Terminator cannot protect those
  ships from contact with limpet parasites.

o Parasites can be affected by gravity.

o Parasites will remain attached to an enemy ship permanently.

o Laser beams and parasites from the same VUX will not affect each other.

o When most ships first enter the combat zone, they materialize in a location
  chosen at random from a limited number of possibilities.  The one exception
  is the VUX Intruder, which, when entering an occupied combat zone, attempts
  to materialize close to the enemy ship's location.  (Note, however, that this
  materialization point is chosen just before the VUX enters the combat zone,
  and while the VUX is decelerating from hyperspace, the enemy ship may have a
  brief moment to move away.)

o If an enemy ship is not moving when a VUX enters and materializes in the
  combat zone, the VUX will usually be facing within 23 degrees of the enemy
  ship's location.  An exception is when two opposing VUX ships simultaneously
  enter the combat zone, in which case the VUX chosen from the bottom team will
  be facing in a random direction.

o VUX captain names: DAK, FIZ, FUP, NRF, ORZ, PIF, PUZ, VIP, YUK, ZEK, ZIK,
  ZIT, ZOG, ZRN, ZUK, ZUP.

o The version of the VUX Intruder that appears in this game varies slightly
  from the version that appeared in earlier Star Control games.  (The limpet
  parasite weapon now launches forward instead of aft.)

<b>36. YEHAT TERMINATOR
====================</b>
o Combat value is 23.  Starts with 20 crew, 10 energy points.

o Ion cannon detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 1 energy point to
  fire.  Can fire 10 pairs of pulse missiles in a row at the highest repeat
  rate if energy is at maximum.  The two missiles do 1 point of damage apiece.

o The Yehat pulse missile is a non-homing projectile.

o Missiles are fired directly forward from a point on the front of each of the
  two wing tips.

o Shield detail: Activated with the C button.  Costs 3 energy points to use.
  Can use 3 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if energy is at maximum.

o The Yehat may fire while shielded.

o The shield will not damage an enemy ship in contact with it.

o While shielded, the Yehat is still vulnerable to damage from collision with
  the planet, energy loss to DOGIs, and the effects of the Melnorme EM
  "confusion" pulse, Orz marine lasers fired inside the Yehat, the Shofixti
  Glory Device, the Syreen Song, and VUX limpet parasites.  While shielded, the
  Yehat also remains vulnerable to changes in inertia caused by contact with
  asteroids, the planet, other ships, Chenjesu DOGIs, the Chmmr tractor field,
  Druuge cannon shells and Orz marines.  Otherwise, no object or projectile at
  any strength can affect the Yehat through its shield.

o If a marine attempts to enter a shielded Yehat, the marine and the ship will
  likely be deflected from one another, and neither will be damaged.

o The Yehat can retrieve hypnotized crew with its shield on.

o Yehat captain names: Beep-eep, Eeep-eep, Feep-eep, Geep-eep, Heep-eep,
  Jeep-eep, Leep-eep, Meep-eep, Neep-eep, Peep-eep, Reep-eep, Teep-eep,

<b>37. ZOQ-FOT-PIK STINGER
=======================</b>
o Combat value is 6.  Starts with 10 crew, 10 energy points.

o Spray weapon detail: Activated with the B button.  Costs 1 energy point to
  fire.  Can fire 10 times in a row at the highest repeat rate if energy is at
  maximum.  A hit does 1 point of damage.

o The Zoq-Fot-Pik forward shot is a non-homing "missile" projectile.

o Shots are fired directly forward from the nose of the ship, but tend to veer
  slightly to port or starboard as they move away.

o Injector/proboscis detail: Activated with the C button.  Costs 7 energy
  points to use.  Can use only 1 time without recharging.  A hit does 12 points
  of damage.

o The Zoq-Fot-Pik proboscis is considered a non-homing "beam" projectile, here.

o Forward shots and the proboscis from the same Zoq-Fot-Pik will not affect
  each other.

  <b>Notes</b>: This list is based not on how fast a ship generates energy, but on how
  quickly a ship will reach its maximum standard energy capacity from a
  zero-energy level.
  <b>The</b> Chenjesu DOGI, Chmmr Zapsat, Orz marine, Slylandro Probe, Umgah Drone,
  Ur-Quan fighter and Utwig Jugger are not included in this list.  The Chenjesu
  DOGI, Chmmr Zapsat and Orz marine do not use energy; The Slylandro Probe and
  Umgah Drone recharge at varying rates depending on how they are manipulated
  by the player (see <a href="#25">section 25: Slylandro Probe</a>, and <a href="#31">section 31: Umgah Drone</a>).
  <b>An</b> Ur-Quan fighter will recharge instantly once it returns to the launching
  Dreadnought; however, it cannot re-energize until it returns, and the
  return-trip time is not a constant.  The Utwig Jugger will recharge at a
  varying rate depending both on how it is manipulated by the player, and on
  the amount and type of enemy fire encountered (see <a href="#34">section 34: Utwig Jugger</a>).

  achieve this.
  <b>The</b> Chenjesu DOGI and Orz Marine are not included in this list, since they do
  not rotate to change heading.
  <b>The</b> Chmmr Zapsat is not included in this list, since a Zapsat's only pivotal

  <b>Notes</b>: Speeds here are maximum speeds attainable, assuming no outside
  influence by collisions, gravity, enemy weapon effects, or counterthrust.
  <b>The</b> Ariloulaleelay Skiff in hyperjump mode is not included in this list.  In
  sustained hyperjump mode, the Arilou could arguably be considered the fastest
  of all ships.  However, a hyperjump covers a random distance in a random
  direction, and as such the Arilou's "speed" here is not a constant.
  <b>The</b> Chenjesu DOGI, Orz marine and Ur-Quan fighter speeds here indicate the
  speed that each of these units will move along a unidirectional path in
  pursuit of a target.  Note that each of these units have the same potential
  top speed, but the DOGI will occasionally slow or halt in place.
  <b>The</b> Chmmr Zapsat's speed here is the speed it will move along a linear path
  in pursuit of its host Avatar ship if the two are separated.
  <b>"Druuge Mauler, reverse thrust"</b> refers to the maximum possible reverse speed
  attainable by the Druuge through repeated use of its cannon.

  strike another without being hit by return fire at the same range.  Note
  however, that many ranges are very closely matched, and as such there may be
  cases where a lower-rated weapon can equal or outreach a higher-rated one,
  depending on the relative hull/weapon orientations at the time of engagement.
  <b>The</b> ranges of the Androsynth Blazer field, Chenjesu DOGI discharger field,
  and the Orz marine laser are all considered to be 0, here.
  <b>Chenjesu</b> DOGIs, Orz marines and Ur-Quan fighters themselves are not
  considered projectiles here, and are classified separately.
  <b>Slylandro</b> weapon ranges are linear between the origin and contact points.
  <b>The</b> range of the Thraddash exhaust pulse is based upon the stationary pulse's
  ability to extend out from under the ship's hull at the moment of generation.

  <b>Notes</b>: This list is sorted based on maximum potential damage done by minimal
  use of a weapon at point-blank range.  Where a single use of a weapon
  projects more than one beam or missile, it is assumed that only 1 projectile
  strikes the target.
  <b>The</b> Chmmr tractor field is not included in this list, as it cannot directly
  damage a target.
  <b>The</b> Chenjesu DOGI discharger field, Melnorme EM "confusion" pulse, and VUX
  limpet parasite are not included in this list, as their effects are not
  comparable to the damage caused by the other weapon systems.
  <b>The</b> Slylandro energizer (asteroid converter field) is not included in this
  list, as this system only affects asteroids.
  <b>The</b> Syreen Song cannot affect a Slylandro Probe, or any target which is
  carrying less than 2 crew members.

<b>39. PROJECTILES
===============</b>
o In this document, the term "projectile" refers to any missile, beam or field
  launched or projected from any ship or other weapons platform.  (Chenjesu
  DOGIs, Orz marines, and Ur-Quan fighters themselves are not considered
  projectiles here, and are classified separately.)

o In this document, the term "damage" generally refers to crew loss on ships,
  and damage to other units such as DOGIs, Zapsats and marines.  For example,
  a projectile that "does 2 points of damage" can remove 2 crew members from a
  ship, remove two-thirds of a DOGI's or marine's defense strength, or remove
  two-tenths (one-fifth) of a Zapsat's defense strength.  (This projectile
  could also destroy an asteroid, as all asteroids are destroyed by a single
  point of damage.)

o Ships can rotate through 16 orientations (360 degrees at 22.5-degree
  intervals).  Non-homing missiles cannot be launched into the "blind spots"
  between these 16 firing angles, and non-homing beams cannot be swept through
  them.

o Most missile projectiles will always move at a fixed speed through
  gravity-free space; their speed will not be added to or subtracted from that
  of the launching ship.  As such, there are occasions where a ship may overrun
  its own projectiles.  Depending on the ship and projectile types involved,
  this may or may not cause damage to the originating ship.

o With the exception of the Chmmr tractor field and the Druuge cannon shell,
  the influence or impact of any projectile will not affect a surviving ship's
  inertia or direction of motion.  With the exception of the Melnorme EM
  "confusion" pulse, the influence or impact of any projectile will not affect
  a surviving ship's orientation in space.

o Most projectiles can be damaged or destroyed on contact with another
  projectile.

o A projectile will cause the same amount of damage regardless of where it
  impacts upon any ship.

  <b>Notes</b>: "Type" is a general classification of these projectiles, where "HM" is
  Homing Missile, "NHM" is Non-Homing Missile, "HB" is Homing Beam, "NHB" is
  Non-Homing Beam, "F" is Field.  "Maximum damage" is the damage inflicted by 1
  projectile at point-blank range; "Maximum usage" is the number of consecutive
  firings at the weapon's maximum repeat rate, assuming a maximum energy level
  and no simultaneous recharging or discharging; "Damage source" is whether or
  not a ship can damage itself with this projectile; "Affect others" is whether
  or not this projectile can damage/destroy other projectiles; "Others affect"
  is whether or not other projectiles can damage/destroy this projectile.

o In general, projectiles of equal Damage Potential ("DP") will destroy each
  other on contact.  Projectiles of unequal Damage Potential will react
  differently depending on the nature and strength of the projectiles involved.
  For example: A Chenjesu crystal Shard does 6 points of damage (DP=6).  An
  Ur-Quan fusion blast (also DP=6) would destroy it on contact (6-6=0).
  However, a Chmmr's main laser beam (DP=2) will have to hit the crystal Shard
  5 times (DP=2*5=10) to destroy it (6-10=0).

o With the exception of the Chmmr Zapsat laser and the Earthling point-defense
  laser, all homing weapons and projectiles track only the enemy ship; they
  will not track asteroids, DOGIs, Zapsats, marines, hypnotized crew, fighters,
  or other projectiles.  No homing weapon or projectile will track the planet.

o Laser beams will cancel each other if their forward points meet.  Laser beams
  which cross will have no effect on each other.

o With the exception of the Mycon plasmoid, a projectile that survives contact
  with another can still inflict its full Damage Potential on a ship.

o Most missile and beam projectiles are destroyed on contact with asteroids,
  the planet, ships, DOGIs, Zapsats, marines or fighters.  Most
  field-projecting weapons blanket a fixed area, and their effects are not
  modified by any object.

o There are some occasions where a ship will glow briefly if its projectiles
  destroy a Chenjesu crystal Shard.  This effect will not cause damage.

o Under normal circumstances, the Chmmr tractor field cannot move an
  Ariloulaleelay Skiff or a Slylandro Probe.  However, if either of those
  target ships have acquired VUX limpet parasites, they can be affected.  The
  more parasites on the target ship, the greater the effect of the tractor
  field.  Note, however, that the Arilou can only be affected while it is
  thrusting.

o A Kohr-Ah plasmoid will destroy asteroids, DOGIs, Zapsats, marines,
  hypnotized crew, fighters, all beam projectiles and most missile projectiles
  on contact.  A Kohr-Ah plasmoid will have no effect on most field
  projectiles.

o The projectiles of the Melnorme Trader have other characteristics which are
  unique among all projectiles.  For further information, see <a href="#18">section 18:</a>
  <a href="#18">Melnorme Trader</a>.

<b>40. POST-COMBAT
===============</b>
o The moment a ship begins to explode, it will no longer respond to player
  control, and will lose all momentum, tangibility, and susceptibility to
  gravity.  With the exception of a self-destructing Shofixti Scout, the
  explosion of a ship will not affect anything else in the combat area.

o When an enemy ship is destroyed, its surviving DOGIs, Zapsats, marines,
  fighters or projectiles (if any) will remain active for a few moments while
  the ship is exploding, and can still affect the remaining ship.  Once a ship
  has finished exploding, its surviving Zapsats, DOGIs, marines, fighters or
  projectiles (if any) disappear from the combat zone.

o DOGIs, Zapsats, marines, fighters, and homing weapons and projectiles are
  unable to track a ship as it is destroyed.  (DOGIs, Androsynth bubbles and
  placed Kohr-Ah mines will remain in a limited area, fighters and marines will
  attempt to return to their host ships, and other homing projectiles will
  proceed along a straight path.  If a new enemy ship enters the combat zone,
  any remaining DOGIs, Zapsats, fighters and homing projectiles may begin to
  track it, but marines will continue to return to their host ship.)

o After an enemy ship is destroyed and removed from combat, a surviving ship
  will have a few moments alone in space before the next enemy ship arrives (or
  the game ends).  During this time, the ship can recharge, maneuver, deploy
  DOGIs or fighters, launch projectiles, gather returning units or hypnotized
  crew, and so on.  Generally, the more time a surviving ship has before the
  next encounter, the greater the potential advantage for that ship.

  <b>Notes</b>: This time scale ranges from a high of about 5.5 seconds to a low of
  about 3 seconds.  Note that these rankings are generalized, and are based on
  rounded analog measurements.

o For as long as it remains in motion, the surviving ship can still be damaged
  or destroyed by a collision with the planet.

o While an Orz marine is returning to the launching Nemesis, it will ignore any
  new enemy ship that enters the combat zone.  (On contact with an enemy ship,
  a returning marine will pass overhead, doing no damage.)

o If both ships in combat are destroyed before one of them is replaced, any
  marines or fighters in the combat zone may scatter in random directions
  before disappearing.

o Hypnotized crew may be retrieved by all ship types except the Slylandro
  Probe.  Crew may retrieved at any time, and can enter a ship through any part
  of its hull.  Hypnotized crew are not cleared from the combat area until they
  are retrieved or until they expire.  Note that any ship which is already
  crewed to its maximum capacity cannot retrieve more crew from space.  In this
  instance the sound effect for successful crew retrieval is played, but in
  reality they are destroyed.

o When all ships of one side have been destroyed, the game ends.  Note that in
  the final summation screen, the last ship(s) destroyed may not always be
  shown as destroyed (crossed out).

<b>41. CYBORG OPPONENT
===================</b>
o If both teams are under Cyborg control, rounds of combat will continue
  automatically and indefinitely unless/until interrupted.  When either side
  has won a game, the team construction screen reappears.  Another game will
  begin after a 10 second countdown.  (Note that this countdown timer begins
  the moment the Cyborg option has been selected for both teams, but is reset
  each time an A, B, C or D button is pressed.  Also, if the cursor is moved
  left, off the list of options, the countdown is cancelled.)

o When choosing a ship for combat, a Cyborg opponent will always select the "?"
  (random choice) icon.

o In general, a ship under Weak Cyborg control cannot engage its "special"
  (C-button) weapon/ability.  The exceptions are the recharging abilities of
  the Pkunk Fury and the Slylandro Probe.

o A Pkunk Fury under Weak Cyborg control will never reincarnate.

o A Cyborg opponent tends to employ the same basic strategy each time when
  using one specific ship type to combat another specific ship type.

o A Cyborg opponent always "knows" where the planet is, and Cyborg-controlled
  ships will usually attempt to avoid a collision with it.

o A Cyborg opponent always "knows" of the existence and exact location of all
  its marines, hypnotized crew members and fighters, and Cyborg-controlled
  ships will usually attempt to retrieve them when necessary (and possible).

o On occasion, when a Cyborg-controlled ship enters the combat zone and
  materializes at the edge of the planet's gravity field, it will refrain from
  using its forward thrust unless/until it is moved by an external force.
