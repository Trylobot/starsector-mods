Because of all the interesting changes to Starfarer, especially the modding-related ones, many ships that weren't possible or practical before have suddenly become so. Here are my future plans in response to this:
- Slylandro Probe: the EMP system type will now provide the intended effect here; deceleration: 0.0 should handle the rest
- Chmmr Avatar: 3x Drones for the ZapSats; still no tractor beam though
- Arilou Laylee'lay Skiff: This ship will now be 100% possible; inertialess drive was already, now it will get Teleportation
- Chenjesu Broodhome: DOGI can be implemented as a special Drone, w/ factory (one-at-time limit)
- Ilwrath Avenger: Phasing (as opposed to Cloaking) should still be super-cool!
- Mmrnmhrm X-Form (X-Wing): "convergeOnPoint" beam weapon spec (cleanliness)
- Orz Nemesis: Space Marines can be partially implemented as Drones (no damage-over-time)
- Ur-Quan Kzer-Za Dreadnought: Fighters can be implemented as Drones, no factory (limited supply)
