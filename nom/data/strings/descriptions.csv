nom_ultralight_blaster,WEAPON,"A miniaturized version of the blaster, specifically designed to hit faster-moving targets, and equipped only on nomad interceptor-class fighters.",Assault,,
nom_light_blaster,WEAPON,"A low-energy pulse beam turret, good for harassing enemy fighters and frigates. Their low OP cost and high efficiency makes them a staple of any Nomad fleet.",Assault,,
nom_heavy_blaster,WEAPON,"Higher-yield Nomad-style pulse blaster, requires more flux than the light blaster but also causes more mayhem. Extraordinarily high efficiency for this type of weapon makes these Nomad favourites.",Assault,,
nom_doom_cannon,WEAPON,"A highly-specialized Nomad pulse wave cannon, designed exclusively for mounting directly onto the internal skeleton that forms the keel of the Gila Monster craft. Absurdly high ordnance and infastructure required to support it, yet as a result it does not have any short-term ammunition limitations. If it can be brought to bear on anything slow-moving and unlucky enough to be in its path, the Nomad Doom Cannon will simply tear it to smoking bits.",Assault,,
nom_scarab,SHIP,"An interceptor-class fighter, this workhorse of the Nomad fleet is capable of standing toe-to-toe with most other fighter types.",,,
nom_iguana,SHIP,"Ultralight frigate designs are rare, because the cost of maintenance and extra crew requirements rarely justify the benefit, but the Nomads swear by this design. They are so light in fact that they are classed as fighters.",,,
nom_wurm,SHIP,"A much beefier frigate when compared with its smaller cousin, this craft is meant to serve as both assault and support, armed most typically with that ubiquitous of Nomad weaponry, the pulse blaster.",,,
nom_komodo,SHIP,"Standard Nomad design applied to a Destroyer class hull. Equipped with a good mix of light and heavy blasters to engage faster-moving fighters and frigates, yet with enough firepower to take on other destroyers and even smaller cruisers.",,,
nom_gila_monster,SHIP,"The Gila Monster is a strangely specialized craft. Most Nomad ships must be able to serve several functions, because they have precious few of them. Designed specifically to take on ancient battleships, which would then be scrapped and looted for parts and supplies to repair and refit the rest of the fleet.",,,
