nom_ultralight_electron_maser,WEAPON,"A miniaturized version of the electron maser, specifically designed to hit faster-moving targets, and equipped only on nomad interceptor-class fighters.",Assault,,
nom_light_electron_maser,WEAPON,"A low-energy pulse beam turret, good for harassing enemy fighters and frigates. Their low OP cost and high efficiency makes them a staple of any Nomad fleet.",Assault,,
nom_heavy_electron_maser,WEAPON,"Higher-yield Nomad-style pulse electron maser, requires more flux than the light electron maser but also causes more mayhem. Extraordinarily high efficiency for this type of weapon makes these Nomad favourites.",Assault,,
nom_twin_electron_maser,WEAPON,"A large slot provides the heat dissipation needed to field a pair of matched electron masers. This weapon fires in a burst, each barrel firing before initiating a short cooling cycle.",,,
nom_doom_cannon,WEAPON,"A highly-specialized Nomad pulse wave cannon, designed exclusively for mounting directly onto the internal skeleton that forms the keel of the Gila Monster craft. Absurdly high ordnance and infastructure required to support it, yet as a result it does not have any short-term ammunition limitations. If it can be brought to bear on anything slow-moving and unlucky enough to be in its path, the Nomad Doom Cannon will simply tear it to smoking bits.",Assault,,
nom_scarab,SHIP,"Scarabs are light and cheap to build, composed of spare parts found commonly on derelict hulls found throughout the Nomads' system of origin, Adum'Tulek. They are most effectively used as scouts.",,,
nom_iguana,SHIP,"Iguana have unusually high flux capacity, but with a crew requirement to match. They are classed as Corvettes, yet fly in three-ship wings and can be field-refitted like fighters.",,,
nom_wurm,SHIP,"Standard Nomad assault frigate, equipped with that staple of Nomad design: the electron maser. Excels at no task in particular, but requires little maintenance.",,,
nom_yellowjacket,SHIP,Employs a single devastating long-range support maser. Lightly armed and armored otherwise.,,,
nom_komodo,SHIP,"Equipped with a good mix of light and medium Nomad weaponry to engage faster-moving fighters and frigates, yet able to hold its own against other destroyers for brief periods.",,,
nom_scorpion,SHIP,"A specialized missile support destroyer. This ship, while expensive to maintain and to field, can bring to bear a frightening volume of long-range ordnance.",,,
nom_sandstorm,SHIP,"The Sandstorm is designed to charge into a fight with frontal weaponry blazing, and take out its target in a single pass. Prolonged engagements usually expose its high flux requirements.",,,
nom_gila_monster,SHIP,"The Gila Monster was invented to take on ancient battleships, such as the Onslaught, which would then be looted for supplies and spare parts to refit the rest of the fleet.",,,
