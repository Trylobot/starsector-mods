Gila Monster
  - playtest the Gila Monster changes further, play both with and against it as
    battleships, cruisers (heavy+light) and destroyers
    
Death Commando (new ship)
  - strike craft comparable to vanilla Hyperion
  - new, unique energy-based strike weapon (name not finalized)
    - name ideas:
      * Thermal Lance
      * Solar Lance
      * Solar Forge Lance
      * Solar Crucible
      * Thermal Crucible
    - will have unique multi-frame chargeup sprite animation that covers most of the ship
      remember the TA/Core avatar you created on dA? like that
  - and three ultralight masers for PD

(Unnamed) (new ship)
  - name ideas:
    * Flycatcher
    * Cactus
    * Thar
  - light carrier, destroyer-class
  - 1 flight deck
  - offensive dual-drone system (sturdy drones kind of like the Tempest's Terminator)
  
(Unnamed) (new ship)
  - name ideas:
    * Kingsnake
    * Rattlesnake
  - cruiser-class
  - armament somewhere between Sandstorm and Komodo

Komodo Mk.II (new ship)
  - based on Komodo
  - heavier armor
  - sprite should depict armor as steel/iron banding around the armor plates
  - with armoured engine mounts
  - slower movement and maneuverability, but higher flux and an additional weapon slot, higher ord.pts.

Campaign Mode
  - create binary system Nur @ 18000,-900
  - spawn Nomad armada in Nur with sufficient supplies, fuel and crew
  - enable dev mode and watch for accidents.
    # scout fleets > more supplies
    # colony fleet > less crew
  - navigation logic:
    - upon creation, armada will be in Nur; immediately head for the nearest hyperspace beacon and jump
    - choose a hyperspace destination which is in range, given current fuel consumption of all fleets
  - resource sharing logic:
    - if, for any given fleet in the armada, the fleet is low on any required resource (supplies/fuel/crew)
      then attempt to borrow the needed amount from all other fleets equally (many-to-one on-demand sharing)
	- if the armada is critically low on any one resource, take a detour
	  - insert a navigation destination into the current sequence, path to the nearest station
	  - once there, refill all the resources for all fleets back to optimal levels (50% of storage capacity)
	- Oasis-specific abilities that apply to the Campaign only
    - Oasis will produce Supplies at a constant rate (rate will be enough to cover usage of an average-sized
      armada when it is all at Max CR; will not cover combat usage or rates while repairing, so can run out
    - Oasis will also produce Green Crew at a constant rate (a low rate) if the current colony_fleet's total
      crew is between a predetermined Min and Max, as a function of the maximum capacity of the Oasis ship.
    - all Oasis abilities will apply regardless of whether the owning fleet is the player's or not.
